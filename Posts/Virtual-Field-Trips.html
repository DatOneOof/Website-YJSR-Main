                        <h2 class="section-heading">Abstract</h2>
                        <p>The current paper explores the possibilities of using virtual reality field trips to promote interactive experiences and create more accessibility for students across the board to have access to artistic and educational resources. VR can enhance the educational experience of marginalized students, living in rural areas, and those who struggle with motivation and academic engagement. It is important to understand the possibilities of VFTs, how they function, and what kind of benefits and drawbacks they can have for students with varying backgrounds, as well as justification that can be proposed for using technology to enhance student experiences. This educational tool is designed for various categories of students to allow them to explore natural environments without leaving the classroom to promote students' retention. In brief, the learning process can change from relying on state-based school infrastructure to a more independent practice with an adapted series of experiences through VR, promote literacy rate and engagement and diversify the learning offer.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>Technology has changed education forever. As witnessed during the Covid-19 pandemic, teachers can teach from home “face-to-face” via Zoom, Google Meet, or other platforms. The innovative technology of Virtual Reality (VR) provides educators with many new ways to motivate and engage their students and assist those who may struggle in a traditional classroom. VR can be used to remove distractions and immerse students in the subject matter at hand. Even the students who lack motivation or those living in remote rural or underprivileged areas can get the most out of their lessons because of the use of highly immersive, novel technology [1].</p>
                        <p>After the use of cell phones and laptops and even maps became widespread, most of us now use a GPS to get around. The new Virtual Reality technology can now take this a step beyond and become a means to visit any place or experience a situation without actually having to move anywhere. This can be significant for many different students. On one hand, it can give access to simulated environments that could not be available in real life, like being underwater or the surface of another planet. On the other, it can also provide ways of experiencing museums, places, and environments that are simply too far away. Simulation can become a way o enhancing and widening what education can do.</p>
                        <p>Virtual Reality can be a completely immersive experience [2] for the contemporary learner. Instead of just watching a documentary about an underwater world, for instance, students can experience a scuba diving virtual journey in the ocean with dolphins, or even, live the experience through a dolphin itself. VR stimulates as many senses as possible, usually using a headset that shows 3-D graphics of the subject matter. Other senses are often stimulated as well: touch, hearing, and sometimes even smell. Learning in this way can improve and enhance the learning environment and increase the attention span of the students to the material [3].</p>
                        <p>VR is one of the main elements that are becoming the future of education. Currently, the school and college sector is the fourth largest investor in VR technology. Both students and teachers are responding with enthusiasm. Also, as a rule, the average student remembers roughly 30% of what they hear and 20% of what they see. When they experience something first-hand, what they remember jumps up dramatically, to 90%. VR provides that real-life type of experience, as it can even simulate the feeling of being in another body, as close as it can get to the actual experience [4].</p>
                        <p>A study published by a group of Southern Taiwan University of Science and Technology scientists [5] show how this dynamic allows students diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder to achieve outstanding results. These are students who often face difficulties in the traditional classroom and might have barriers to success. They tend to get distracted easily and often feel frustration, and ADHD can be associated with lower self-esteem, which feeds into the lack of results and then into an even lower self-esteem. Students might be more impulsive and feel restless, so it is difficult for them to stay still as required by traditional educational environments. These students can overcome aspects of their difficulties in the classroom when VR enters the picture. It allows them to interact and have meaningful relationships with both peers and adults in VR-based classrooms.</p>
                        <p>Similarly, students who live in rural areas and in underprivileged areas could make VR could have better chances to learn high-quality material and have access to global knowledge and promote their technological skills. VR could even be the playing field by giving students everywhere equal access to highly stimulating environments and options for visiting important places. The power of incorporating VR into today’s classrooms provides benefits to students, teachers, and schools and upgrades skilled applicants for the job market.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Objectives</h2>
                        <p>This paper aims to spread education in marginalized areas and stimulate interactive classroom environments using virtual-based field trips (VFTs). Students from all over the world, with divergent backgrounds, will have access to this interactive educational system. This is expected to lead to more involvement, creativity, and innovation among these students. VR could provide benefits to educational performance and technological literacy, as it involves a change from regular classroom dynamics and can offer new technological tools that make the experience feel like a game.</p>
                        <p>The practical objective of this paper is to upgrade the learning experience of the students by offering simulation field trips in various subjects (science, art, social sciences, history, and more), and explore how students might respond to this type of project.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Methods</h2>
                        <p>The target population of virtual based learning is high school students. Disengagement, lack of interest, and lack of access can be key factors that limit student achievement. As many as 20% of students might face disengagement, and it will not always be obvious, as is the case with hidden disengagement [6].</p>
                        <p>This project uses virtual reality field trips in classrooms to promote interactivity and exploration of different learning environments. They are designed for elementary to high school students, but can be customized for students of different ages. Virtual field trips allow students to travel the world and explore natural environments without leaving the classroom. Each virtual field trip contains a video, a teacher guide, and student activities that promote retention. Virtual field trips will take students to a unique environment and can be easily customized by the students too. There are options for different subject areas [7]. Students can have an interactive session through this technology if they have the basic equipment.</p>
                        <p>VR helps enhance learning by allowing students to interact with their lessons and experience them in several ways through direct contact. All students can participate and interact with the environment, like a video game, engage with the elements offered, and choose which elements to focus on. Student activities can go beyond pen and paper and instead feature hands-on dynamics. Instead of just reading about a subject, students can see the things they are learning, helping them understand complex topics. Without the worry of risk assessments, extensive planning, and parent permission. Virtual environments are safe and accessible, which can provide benefits for parents. For schools, they are a cost-effective measure that minimize the need for transportation and logistics. As an example, a teacher can start a journey by taking their class to Australia. Next and without any time or additional obstacles, the students can go on a short trip across the Pacific Ocean to explore the Grand Canyon in the USA. This allows students to visualize what they are seeing and engage in new experiences that offer more immersion, engagement, and interactivity.</p>
                        <p>Virtual field trips can involve aspects of planning and logistics, such as having the right equipment and all the activities. It is important for the teacher to plan for tasks, like discussions, demonstrations, group work, commenting, and beyond, as well as take advantage of existing digital tools that can include the necessary activities as part of the experience. Using VR allows the teacher to get quick engagement and evaluate the results right away.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Findings</h2>
                        <p>The implementation of this technology in learning at school or at home could change the architecture of the learning process and provides students with endless possibilities with VR technology and with a creative and interactive experience [9]. Using VR in the classroom empowers teachers to personalize lessons, helps children who struggle with attention problems, and enhances learning for students who require and benefit from more hands-on and sensory experiences. They can visit the ruins of ancient Rome for social studies or the landscape of Mars for science. This experience can benefit from the process of gamification, making the virtual field trip feel more like a game without losing on the effectiveness of the learning process.</p>
                        <p>The use of various apps that are currently available, students can recreate a setting of a story for English and then step into that setting. Teachers can create role-playing games for students and put them in the middle of a 3-D story. That story could be fictional to explore literature or have historical value. A science teacher could use a virtual roller coaster to demonstrate kinetic energy to their students. There are limitations to virtual field trips. It would be important to consider whether the desired programs and environments are available. For some schools, support and implementation would be essential at the beginning stages of the project, as not all schools could afford virtual reality equipment right away.</p>
                        <p>A central consideration would be the normalization of the practice and a widespread implementation, as this could allow schools in rural areas or marginalized areas to benefit as well and make it easier for these schools, which often need support the most to receive it. However, even with technological or financial limitations, virtual field trips could become a way of promoting equal education.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Implications</h2>
                        <p>This use of virtual reality field trips in learning situations can bring tremendous changes in educational results. In Morocco, there is an illiteracy rate of 40%. New classroom strategies that are more sensory-based, immersive, and game-like could be a means to enhance literacy among marginalized and underprivileged areas. With investment into education and civil society’s involvement to raise funds for the required equipment, the learning process can change from relying on state-based school infrastructure to a more independent practice with a customized series of experiences through VR. Other potential benefits would involve increasing literacy and engagement. More possibilities to learn from home, by oneself, and in classroom will diversify the pedagogical approach and provide incentives for the students to be more interested in attending new forms of classes that appeal to navigation, playing games, and explore ideas in an interactive way.</p>
