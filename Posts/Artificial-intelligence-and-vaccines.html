                        <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>With the ever-evolving technology, there are various developments that are creating paradigm shifts in the healthcare field, for example, immunology.</p>
                        <p>The concept of introducing antibodies to a person’s body to create resistance against the antigen through weakening the forms of the latter was first discovered by Edward Jenner against smallpox. Gradually, several techniques have been created to improve and make the discovery of vaccinations even more efficient.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
                        <p>Artificial Intelligence is the skill possessed by machines or simple applications that can mimic the human mind’s disposition like decision-making, prediction based on analysis, sentiment analysis, cognitive ability, and more. It has made time-consuming tasks more efficient and convenient.</p>
                        <p>Daily life instances include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Voice Assistants like Alexa, Google Duplex, Siri, and Cortana.</li>
                            <li>Chatbots on Customer Service Websites.</li>
                            <li>A.I. applications in hospitals that automatically maintain patient information, record, and aid in diagnostics.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Internal Composition of Vaccines & Inhibitions of Viruses in The Body</h2>
                        <p>Usually, vaccines consist of specific parts of dead viruses like the proteins of Hepatitis B, but many immunologists predict that in the future it will compose of protein fragments that can elicit a better immune response.</p>
                        <p>So, how can the virus be prevented from spreading throughout the body with the help of the induced antibodies? One way is the protein produced by our B lymphocytes. Viruses live on the borderline between living and nonliving organisms. Due to this characteristic of theirs, they tend to mutate easily and mark each cell of the body with a particular protein fragment that sends a response to T-cells to attack the infection introduced to the cell. With the help of this theory, scientists have been able to create machine learning models that can predict the type of viral fragments and which part of the virus is immunogenic.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">How does a Machine Learning Model Work?</h2>
                        <p>Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence wherein the model analyses patterns in large datasets to create an accurate prediction. The principle of working and learning from various experiences. In the case of this experiment, it can observe patterns that can be difficult for the immunologists to explore as they can be minute. Although researchers can identify millions of fragments that can be visible to the T-lymphocytes in a simple virus such as influenza, what would happen in a situation of a novel virus like the Sars-CoV-2[Covid-19]. Well, this is where the machine learning models come in for the predictions by meticulously analyzing the datasets of the protein fragment formation on the cell, from the Covid-19.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">The Process of Making the Covid-19 Vaccine With Machine Learning</h2>
                        <p>With the inception of the pandemic, microbiologists and immunologists were on the run to find the immunological components of the pathogen with the help of machine learning models so they could finalize good vaccine options. Finally, the model caught a minute observation of spike proteins that ensured the entry of the virus into lung cells and locked with them, creating pulmonary issues. This spike protein produced a fragment called, SYGFQPTNGVGYQPY, which the T-cells would produce antibodies to lock with the protein and attack them, which could be represented and easily dealt with by the antibodies produced.</p>
                        <p>The paradigm shift machine learning models has been created in domains of drug discovery or vaccines which is bringing much more efficient outcomes and results in the healthcare facilities. The key factor for the performance of these models depends on the training dataset it receives which should always be authentic and reliable to yield the latest types of Covid vaccines.</p>
