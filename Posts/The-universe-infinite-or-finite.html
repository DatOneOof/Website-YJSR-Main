                        <p>Let’s go all the way back to the beginning. To the time when our universe was as simple as a hot, ultra-dense ball of matter and antimatter.</p>
                        <p>13.8 billion years ago, there was an explosion called the Big Bang. This explosion was so colossal that our entire universe was born because of it. When that ball became so dense, it exploded and filled our universe with matter, antimatter, radiation, creating galaxies, planets, Nebulae and all of the cosmic beings that we know and are amazed by today.</p>
                        <p>After the Big Bang occured, the universe entered an expanding-and-cooling state.Over many billions of years, the universe has been expanding faster and faster. Now, in the 21st century, our observable universe has expanded to be 46 billion light years in radius! Think about that for a second. 46 BILLION LIGHT YEARS. Light travels at a speed of about 300 million meters per second so traveling for 46 billion years, that is an insane amount of distance.</p>
                        <p>Although that’s such an unimaginable distance, it’s not infinitely large so the question still stands. What about the unobservable Universe? Is there any way to use what we know about the known universe that we have been studying for thousands of years to answer the question of whether it’s finite or infinite. Does it go on forever or is there a sort of limit out there, somewhere in space?</p>
                        <p>Currently, we aren’t sure. Some theories say that the Universe could expand forever but it could also be finite. Why? Because it could be that the Universe has a very large volume now, but finite, and that that volume will increase, so only in the infinite future will it actually be infinite. If this is confusing, my apologies. Let’s break it down.</p>
                        <p>Our known universe will have an inevitable end at some point in the future and there are three ways that could occur, sooner or later.</p>
                        <p style="font-weight: 900">1. The Big Rip</p>
                        <p>For the galaxies, planets and other celestial objects to keep occuring, there must be a form of fundamental gravity that holds them together and balances the universe. This enormous rip will occur when the pull/force of the universe's expansion (since it’s expanded so quickly every second) becomes stronger than the gravitational pull that holds it together. The forces that hold atoms together would cancel out and cause the atoms to disintegrate while the universe disappears and all that's left are free particles in a dark, dark vacuum of space.</p>
                        <p style="font-weight: 900">2. The Big Crunch</p>
                        <p>If theoretically, our universe has less dark energy than we think, or has been decreasing over time, eventually gravity would become the most powerful force in the universe. If this occurs, the rate at which the universe expands will slow down and the universe will begin to shrink (a reverse effect). Because of this, the cosmos will begin to collapse on itself and galaxies will collide and merge. A universe that is shrinking, is a very hot universe so because of this, the background radiation of the cosmos will become so extremely hot to the point where it would roast stars from the inside out. Right before the crunch, the extreme heat would rip atoms apart and during that period, black holes would eat up all of the leftover matter in the cosmos before merging into a single giant black hole.</p>
                        <p style="font-weight: 900">3. The Big Freeze</p>
                        <p>In the theoretical scenario of the big freeze, instead of matter being ripped apart, they would stay intact but slowly decaying to radiation as the universe expands. The expansion would stretch everything out until the matter in the universe is evenly spread. If this happens, objects can gain or lose energy. The gas clouds that form stars would dissipate, black holes would evaporate, and eventually, even light particles would fizzle out. The universe would be completely snuffed out forever.</p>
                        <p>After taking a look at these three theoretical endings to our universe, we see that our universe might end in the next few billions of years. That in turn means that only if the universe doesn’t end, it might be infinite but because of this reasoning, the universe has to be finite because it has an end.</p>
                        <p>But what is the most significant issue of all? It's the fact that we don't have enough knowledge to answer the question definitively. We only know how to get information from within our visible Universe, which spans 46 billion light years in every direction. The answer to the most important issue of all, whether the Universe is finite or infinite, may be stored in the Universe itself, but we don't have adequate access to it to find out. All we'll have are possibilities and theories until we figure it out or discover a creative technique to increase what we know physics is capable of.</p>
                        <p>Wait. What about the Multiverse, the theory that has been confusing and thrilling scientists for many years?</p>
                        <p>Well, the multiverse theory suggests that our universe, which inside of it has hundreds of billions of galaxies and extreme entities that are unfathomable and span tens of billions of light-years, may not be the only universe out there.</p>
                        <p>Instead, there might be an uncountable or infinite number of universes that have similar or different qualities to our known universe.</p>
                        <p>The multiverse is of course hypothetical but either way, we believe that these universes would be those who comprise everything that exists: the entirety of space, time, matter, energy, as well as the physical laws and constants that describe them.</p>
                        <p>But, some things have been figured out by particle physicists and other scientists around the globe who are fascinated by this concept and have been studying it for years:</p>
                        <p>A multiverse of a somewhat different kind has been envisaged within string theory and its higher-dimensional extension, M-theory.[63]</p>
                        <p>It was theorized in the early 21st century that all the theories of the multiverse require the presence of eleven spacetime dimensions (one of time and ten of space). Currently, we only know of four dimensions of space time so might these other dimensions be? <br>The extra seven dimensions are theorized to be compacted on a very small scale, which brings string theory into the equation.</p>
                        <p>String theory (with specific connection to the multiverse theory) states that this compactification produces a different spacetime, meaning that string theory can realistically predict a multiverse populated by an uncountable number of different universes.</p>
                        <p>It smooths out the mathematical inconsistencies that currently exist between quantum mechanics and the theory of relativity. String theory  tries to explain that the entire universe, fundamentally is built of very small quantum strings that vibrate in ten or eleven dimensions. This would make these dimensions unseeable so we can’t make a set classification just yet.</p>
                        <p>But, let’s talk about a certain search for evidence that also occurred  in the early 21st century.  Scientists analyzed and created a device who’s data claims to find evidence suggesting that this universe collided with other (parallel) universes in the distant past. However in the future, after many calculations and theories being taken into consideration, scientists did not reveal any statistically significant evidence of this type of collision. Also, there was no evidence of any gravitational pull of other universes on ours from 13.8 billions years ago. Wasn’t that the time when the Big Bang occurred? Yes it was!</p> 
                        <p>Scientists have also stated that maybe our Big Bang was actually not just the start to our universe, but the end to another. That theory makes it seem as this string of universes that end and are born, die and rebirth is infinite and that in a few million or billion years, another Big Bang will occur in our known universe while starting another, making the universe as we know it, gone.</p>
                        <p>Today, the main problem for physicists is that they still lack evidence of other universes, or even good ideas for obtaining evidence. Many nonetheless insist our cosmos really is just a spot of dust in a vast “multiverse.”</p>
                        <p>Quantum mechanics describes not just very small things but everything, including us. As far as we currently know, quantum mechanics is the truth and the facts of everything we have come to know.  However preposterous it might seem, a multiverse, would be a consequence of quantum mechanics.</p>
                        <p>As I stated before, string  theory tells us a story that consists of fantasies that all the forces of nature stem from strings moving and flowing 10 or 11 different dimensions which would imply that our cosmos is some small part of the multiverse.</p>
                        <p style="font-weight: 900">What about an idea called Chaotic inflation?</p>
                        <p>To put it simply, CI is a supercharged version of the big bang theory, that tells us that our universe is a very small bubble in an infinite sea of universes.</p>
                        <p>So, we have all of these theories ranging from string theory to classical mechanics to relativity but, do they actually tell us something practical. Not exactly.</p>
                        <p>Because of this, scientists have become less entertained by theories of the multiverse. But why exactly?</p>
                        <p>First of all, science has been at an all time low for a while for  both internal and external reasons.</p>
                        <p>We need to focus on theories that make more sense and also on research today to figure out different issues of our universe, not a theory that says that there might be more universes. Many scientists believe this and some believe that scientists should really be doing something more productive with their time and that this theory that may or not be true should be left on the side for now.</p>
                        <p>That’s regarding the multiverse theory but this also connects to the topic of this blog, if the universe or even the multiverse is infinite or finite.</p>
                        <p>Now, we will keep searching and searching for an answer but for now, everything is a mystery that even the smartest minds around the globe have yet to solve.</p>
