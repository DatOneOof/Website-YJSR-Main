                        <p>What if I told you that scientists were now closer than ever to bringing things back to life? That’s precisely what happened in both a 2019 and a 2022 experiment where researchers from Yale found that they could restore some cellular activity to dead cells using new technologies called BrainEx and OrganEx. <br><br> BrainEx is a series of pumps and filters that circulate a solution through the brain. In the 2019 experiment, pig brains were isolated for four hours before getting hooked up to BrainEx. BrainEx was connected to the arteries of the brains and pumped 2 solutions. One was a control solution made up of antibiotics and inorganic salts. Another was a special BrainEx solution, made up of vitamins, amino acids, antibiotics, inorganic salts, metabolic factors, and cellular protective agents. These are all needed for cells to function. <br><br> After 1 hour, they found the BrainEx solution slowed down the deterioration of the brain and preserved the synapse. It also made the effects of anoxia and ischemia on the cellular structure less severe. They then took a slice of the hippocampus and using electrodes found that the patterns were similar to a fresh brain taken out of a skull one hour after death. This suggests that the BrainEx solution restored neural activity, or prevented its loss of it, Although it was small-scale activity, just individual neurons. The brains that had BrainEx solutions pumped through them looked a world better than the ones that had the control or no solution pumped through them. <br><br> The most recent experiment was similar to the 2019 one, using OrganEx, an evolution of BrainEx. The pigs had been dead an hour from Ischemia, a condition in which blood and oxygen flow are restricted. OrganEx is a perfusion device, similar to the heart-lung machine. They then pumped different solutions through different organs and found they could significantly slow down cellular deterioration and restore cellular activity in the heart, liver, kidney, and brain. <br><br> In the heart there was even electrical activity, meaning the heart could now contract. The most amazing thing was involuntary muscle movement in the head and neck area, showing the preservation of motor functions. The OrganEx solution, similar to the BrainEx solution, contained oxygen, a synthetic form of hemoglobin, electrolytes, and compounds meant to prevent blood clots. <br><br> The implications of this technology are staggering. We now have technology that at some point could bring animals and even people back to life. It also has us confronting our definition of death, the process of death, and the ethical implication of bringing someone back to life. Since there was no brain activity, or thought, in the pigs during either of the experiments the technology doesn’t have a practical use yet. But researchers are continuing to experiment, and advancements with this technology could and will change our world forever.</p>
