                        <h2 class="section-header">Abstract</h2>
                        <p>Recently, medical waste management has become a critical issue, given its vast negative economic and environmental impacts. Due to the rising focus on healthcare, the volume of medical waste has also increased and is subsequently driving demand for pharmaceutical and infectious waste management solutions.</p>
                        <p>Specifically, medical waste left uncontrolled in nature acts as harmful chemicals. These chemicals cause increased carbon emissions, pollution of water resources, and a decrease in biodiversity. These can affect the lives of living things acutely, as well as damage ecosystems in the long term. Released hazardous chemicals increase levels of toxic substances which can cause genetic defects and diseases.</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-header">Medical Waste</h2>
                        
                        <p>Medical waste includes potentially harmful microorganisms that can infect hospital patients, health workers, and other living beings. Medical waste is all waste produced by health facilities, medical laboratories, and biomedical research facilities, and potentially from other small places like homes.</p>
                        
                        <h6><u>Negative health consequences associated with medical waste and by-products:</u></h6>
                        <p>Medical waste may cause sharp injuries and chemical burns from disinfection, sterilization, or other waste treatment activities. The environment may be exposed to cytotoxic drugs (which contain chemicals that are highly toxic to cells), antibiotics, mercury or dioxins (environmental pollutants) during the disposal or incineration of medical waste. Additionally, the release of particulate matter during medical waste incineration and carbon emissions increases air pollution. Medical waste produced by nuclear medicine technologies such as positron emission tomography (PET) or computed tomography (CT) is also hazardous since they include radioactive materials.</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-header">How Big is This Problem?</h2>
                        <p>Treatment and disposal of healthcare waste may pose health risks indirectly through the release of pathogens and toxic pollutants into the environment.</p>
                        <ul class="cont-list">
                            <li>The disposal of untreated medical waste can contaminate drinking areas and other water sources, including groundwater, if landfills are not constructed appropriately.</li>
                            <li>Healthcare waste with chemical hazards can get released into the environment if these substances are not handled, stored and disposed of in a proper way. Increased levels of toxic substances can cause genetic defects, disease, headaches, nausea, and many more issues that can seriously impact organisms’ lives and cause biodiversity loss.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>Incineration is widely used as a waste disposal method, but insufficient incineration or burning of unsuitable materials results in the discharge of pollutants into the air and therefore the formation of ash residues.Only modern incinerators operating at 850-1100°C and fitted with special gas-cleaning equipment are ready to be suitable for the international emission standards for dioxins and furans.</p>
                        <p>Take the healthcare industry’s carbon emissions—if healthcare were a country, it would be the fifth-largest emitter of greenhouse gases on the planet, according to the non-profit organization Health Care Without Harm. The loop of transporting medical waste between treatment facilities and landfills ends up using an immense amount of fossil fuels. Besides, most of the treatment facilities are many miles away from the location to pick up. Multiplying this by the quantity of times that the medical waste has to be picked up over per year makes medical waste contribute to a significant amount of carbon emissions.</p>
                        <p>If we consider Covid-19 medical waste, 85% of the waste is considered general waste, and the other 15% of the medical waste is classified as hazardous, which means it needs special resources to be disposed of.</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-header">What Can We Do?</h2>
                        <p>We can start by developing strategies and systems to face the problem of healthcare waste and inform people to reduce health care waste. In order to reduce the negative effects of medical waste, people should be aware of the economic and environmental impacts of medical waste. Whenever possible, facilities should use safe and environmentally-friendly healthcare waste treatments such as autoclaving, using microwave ovens, integrated steam treatment with internal mixing, and chemical treatment instead of medical waste incineration.</p>
                        <p>One of the primary ways to cut back on the carbon footprint of medical waste is to promote on-premise treatment options. Treating waste onsite allows facilities to skip the necessity for a third party to return to gather waste for treatment, accordingly eliminating the fuel and landfill space typically used. This selection is not only safe but at the same time also makes it easy for medical staff to treat the waste they produce and dispose of it through a regular, municipal trash system. When the need for transportation of waste is dissolved, there are less carbon emissions. In the same way, the land footprint is reduced because the on-premise thermal process results in a decline in the mass of the picked up medical waste itself. Therefore, the amount reached to landfills is minimal, which saves land in the long term. In addition to all these solutions, the most important is to make conscious production and consumption of medical materials to minimize the negative impact of medical waste.</p>
