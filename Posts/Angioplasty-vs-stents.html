                        <h2 class="section-heading">Angioplasty</h2>
                        <p style="text-indent: 45px;">In 1974, at the Medical Polyclinic of the University of Zürich, German-born physician-scientist Andreas Grüntzig (1939–1985) used a balloon-tipped catheter for the first time to reopen a severely stenosed femoral artery, a procedure he initially referred to as "percutaneous transluminal dilatation.” Angioplasty is a treatment that improves blood flow in narrowed or obstructed coronary arteries. The heart is always receiving blood through the coronary arteries. When a person has coronary artery disease, there is a buildup of plaque in the coronary arteries. The plaque is caused due to a buildup of cholesterol, calcium, and other chemicals. It might constrict or completely clog your arteries over time. Some areas of your heart may not receive enough blood as a result of this. Angioplasty is a procedure that expands a clogged artery so that more blood can flow through it. It is also referred to as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Angioplasty is a procedure that doctors perform to relieve chest pain caused by blockages in the coronary arteries. Angina is the medical term for this type of pain. There are different types of angina, and angioplasty treats only certain types. In some cases, angioplasty is an emergency treatment during or right after a heart attack. Angioplasty does not cure coronary artery disease. To help prevent more plaque blockages, it is necessary to take any prescribed medicines, eat healthy foods, and get regular exercise.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Stents</h2>
                        <p style="text-indent: 45px;">Charles Thomas Stent (1807–1855) was an English dentist known for his advances in denture-making. He was best known for improving and modifying the gutta-percha denture base, creating the Stent's compounding that made it practical as a material for dental impressions. A stent is a tiny mesh tube used to keep open pathways in the body, such as weak or restricted arteries, open. Stents are commonly used to correct constricted coronary arteries, which supply oxygen-rich blood to the heart. Stents are also used to treat aneurysms, which are bulges in the artery's wall, and narrowed airways in the lungs. Stenting is a procedure that is considered minimally invasive, which means it isn't considered major surgery.</p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 45px;">Stented devices can be made of metal mesh, fabric, silicone, or a combination of materials. Metal mesh stents are used to open coronary arteries. Fabric stents, also known as stent grafts, are used to treat larger arteries like the aorta. Silicone stents are commonly used in pulmonary airways. To avoid serious complications, your healthcare provider may advise you to take this medicine for a year or longer after receiving a stent in your artery. Airway stents are used in the airways of the lungs. Metal stents can be made of bare metal or coated with a material like silicone. Hybrid stents are made up of a variety of materials. Silicone stents are made of a plastic-like material that can be molded into any shape.</p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 45px;">Stent grafts are used to treat aortic aneurysms with aortic aneurysm stents. Typically, a stent-graft is a leak-proof polyester tube with a metal mesh backbone. Stent grafts are used to provide a stable channel for blood to flow through larger arteries, such as the aorta. Some stents are used specifically in the coronary or carotid arteries. Simple metal mesh tubes that can be used in both the coronary and carotid arteries are known as bare-metal stents. The most common type of stent used in coronary arteries are drug-eluting stents. They're coated with medicine that slowly releases into the artery, preventing it from narrowing again. Different medicines are coated on different types of drug-eluting stents. After a few months, biodegradable stents dissolve. When the need is only temporary, this type of stent can be useful. Another procedure to remove these stents is not needed because they dissolve. The FDA approved the use of 3D printed stents in 2020. These stents can be made to fit each patient and their needs.</p>
                        <h2 class="secton-heading">Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>The combination of angioplasty and stenting can save a person's life, especially if done soon after a heart attack. It can significantly improve blood flow, protect the heart muscle from further damage, as well as help with heart disease symptoms like angina (chest pain) and shortness of breath.</p>
