                        <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>Meet the Antikythera mechanism. The earliest precision tool discovered thus far. In the early 1900s, this mechanism was uncovered in the nearby sea on the isle of Antikythera in a sunken shipwreck, proclaimed a "useless waste of space". While this mechanism sat in a person's desk drawer for years, rotting away or being used as a paperweight. The stone that the mechanism was encased in began to fall away and decay, separating into three pieces and revealing what was inside. Scientists later concluded it was a random assortment of gears and bolts. It had hardly been researched and stayed so until a few years back. When the scientist, Derek Price, a young student interested in the effects of science on society, obtained special clearance to examine the mechanism and figure out what was going on, he performed a slew of experiments in an attempt to figure out what had been occurring. He got stuck and stayed stumped despite several radiation examinations and more x-rays than one could count. Much later, the MRI machine was created, finally giving insight into what was occurring within the mechanism without entirely tearing apart the rock and potentially breaking the secrets it held within.</p>
                        <p>It was created for the ancient Greeks to track time, but instead of using a specific time system that would later come into play, they used a more generalized system using the sun, eclipses, seasons, etc. The Antikythera mechanism became an extremely accurate way to tell time. Depicting a heliocentric universe instead of the geocentric one that the church seemed dead set on, with their belief that God would put his "greatest masterpiece" at the center of the universe. Due to the theocracy they resided within, the heliocentric model managed to murder or kill astounding numbers for opposing the church's ideals. This mechanism functioned as an evolved orrery. Which was a model of what they believed to be our solar system and a way to track time or how the planets moved within it. Orrerys were widespread throughout Greece as a representation of the nobles and wealth that resided there or within the scientific groups that were so very prominent at the time.</p>
                        <p>The Antikythera mechanism consists of many gears, ranging from as small as 15 teeth wide to 223 teeth wide, with 223 being the number of full moons it takes on average for a lunar eclipse to occur. This mechanism also has many letters and characters inside and out, depicting what it is used for and how to use it. One of those ways is to predict the movements of the planets with extreme accuracy. The only offset is the location of Mars, which is around 38 degrees off but could have been precise considering the movement of planets over 2,000 years, the estimated age of the box; this also possessed the ability to track the Olympic games reoccurring every four years in Greece. It showed the Greek cycles of the lunar calendar to see the sky in a whole new light, or lack thereof, which seems more accurate given the situation. The instrument mainly functioned on a diurnal calendar, which is a cycle following the sun, instead of the nocturnal calendar, which follows the moon. This instrument was so precise that it was even called into accuracy within tenths of a millimeter. Which is unheard of for technology at that time, thought to be so far behind modern-day technology. That perfection at a nearly unthinkable level this amazing discovery may now lay claim to the first precision instrument ever created within the records of history.</p>
