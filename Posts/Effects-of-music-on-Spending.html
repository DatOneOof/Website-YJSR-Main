                        <h2 class="section-heading">Context</h2>
                        <p>North et al. (2003)’s research has shown that music style has an effect on the amount of money spent by customers, there are different explanations as to why music influences consumer behavior. North et al’s study concluded that there was a significant difference in spending between music conditions and that classical music led to significantly higher spending in restaurants compared to pop music or no music. However, the study was conducted in a restaurant in the UK, therefore this can raise questions about cultural differences, as the influence of music might vary between cultures thus, we wanted to conduct our research to see the influence of music on spending decisions across different cultures mainly within Pakistan.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Aim</h2>
                        <p>The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of types of music (pop and classical) on customer’s spending in a restaurant.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Sample</h2>
                        <p>More than 140 participants, including individuals of all genders and from the ages of 13 and 60, completed the questionnaire used for sample acquisition. The mean age of the participants was estimated to be 27. The distribution of the questionnaire transpired through an online forum. Participants, originating from varied racial and ethnic backgrounds, (mainly Pakistanis) engaged with the questionnaire using mobile phones and laptops, ensuring that there was no bias.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Procedure</h2>
                        <p>In this experiment, a web survey/questionnaire was used to gather responses. The independent variable was the type of music (classical and pop) and the dependent variable was the customer’s spending in each restaurant. Over 12 interviews were conducted as well using the same questions in the questionnaire to reduce the risk of demand characteristics. The questionnaire included open ended questions, close ended questions as well as filler questions in order to reduce demand characteristics.</p>
                        <p>The questionnaire contained two parts; the first part contained filler questions such as ‘what type of food do you like the most,’ “Fast food?” “Homemade food” “Desi food?” "Healthy food?”And general information questions like the participant’s age, gender, and place of residence.</p>
                        <p>The first part of the questionnaire contained a scenario about 2 music conditions, one restaurant playing pop music and the other playing classical music, the scenario required participants to imagine themselves sitting in those restaurants and while responding to questions for each condition (pop and classical). They were asked to listen to the music for which the links were provided in the description of the respective section. This was done so that the music participants imagine is the same for everyone.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Scenario</h2>
                        <p>“Imagine that you are in a street with 2 restaurants, all painted brown to match the street's ambience. It’s another normal day in your life when you feel like eating at a restaurant.</p>
                        <p>Restaurant no.1 has  English/Pakistani/Bollywood (classical) music playing.</p>
                        <p>Restaurant no.2 has English/Pakistani/Bollywood  (pop) music playing. There will be 3 songs playing in each of the 2 restaurants (English, Bollywood and Pakistani).</p>
                        <p><i>Now that you have imagined the scene, please answer the following questions for each of the 2 restaurants, keeping in mind the instructions below:</i></p>
                        <ol class="cont">
                            <li>Remember that you are going to the restaurant alone.</li>
                            <li>All the restaurants offer salads, homemade food, desi food, fast food, drinks, and desserts.</li>
                            <li>While answering the questions please make sure that you play the music (3 audio links in the description)  attached with each section.”</li>
                        </ol>   
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Results</h2>                                                                                                                                       
                        <p>A majority of the participants, 40.7%, when asked generally about their spendings in restaurants, the participants spent between $10-$20 (2783 Rs - 5567 Rs). Only 15% of the participants selected the highest amount on the questionnaire, which is between $30-$40 (8351 Rs - 11135 Rs).</p>
                        <p>62 participants in classical music condition stated that they would spend between $1-$10 (278 Rs - 2783 Rs), this being the majority, when dining out with classical music being played in the background, while only 7 participants that were the minority stated that they would spend the highest amount of money, which is between $30-$40 (8351 Rs - 11135 Rs).</p>
                        <p>And in the pop music condition, a majority of the participants (58 participants), stated that they would spend between $10-$20 (2783 Rs - 5567 Rs) when dining there. And 15 participants stated that they would spend the highest amount which is $30-$40 (8625 Rs - 11,500 Rs)</p>
                        <p>Results further revealed that 66% of participants said that music playing does affect their choice to choose a restaurant to visit, and more females than males said that the music will affect their overall dining experience.</p>
                        <p>In the classical music restaurant condition, 140 participants, 45 out of 85 female participants and 30 out of 55 male participants stated they would perceive the restaurant positively and revisit it if classical music was played. In pop music restaurant condition, 44 females out of 85 females and 29 out of 55 males stated that they would have a positive experience in this restaurant and would visit again. In the restaurant playing pop music, the majority of male participants said they would spend $1-$10 and female participants said they would spend $10-$20. In the classical music restaurant, a majority of both male and female participants selected the $1-$10 option for spending in the restaurant.</p>
                        <p>It can be noted that participants other than these did not provide definitive answers to this particular question.</p>
                        <p>The obtained data revealed distinct preferences among participants, with 34.3% favoring fast food, and 59.3% expressing a preference for homemade and traditional dishes. Moreover, 62.9% indicated a preference for restaurants with background music, while 37.1% preferred an ambience without music.  Notably, when asked about specific genres, 60% participants said that they like pop music and 57 participants they like classical music.</p>
                        <p>This observation underscores a direct correlation between music choice and increased spending, while a minority of participants exhibited indifference, focusing  primarily on the culinary aspects unaffected by the musical ambience.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusions</h2>
                        <ul class="cont">
                            <li>Participants were willing to spend more in the pop music restaurant as compared to the classical music restaurant.</li>
                            <li>More people appreciate background music in restaurants.</li>
                            <li>Females are more likely to revisit the restaurant as compared to males.</li>
                            <li>The study's findings also led to the conclusion that the presence of background music enhances  the overall ambience according to participant preference.</li>
                            <li>Females spent more money in pop music condition than in the classical music condition.</li>
                            <li>Males spent more in classical condition than in pop; however, the difference was not statistically significant.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Evaluation</h2>
                        <p>There are many benefits to having an online questionnaire through an online platform (google forums). To start with, the approach of online questionnaires could be wider such that it includes different participants from various backgrounds. This will, therefore, increase the generalizability due to the diversified sample. Additionally, data can be collected quickly using online format hence getting away with time-consuming, paper-based results collection. This way, we can store our findings in soft copies which will be helpful in further references. Furthermore, the anonymity provided by online platforms may reduce social desirability bias and enable participants to give more truthful responses.</p>
                        <p>The results would thus not be valid unless there is accurate data whereby the data can be analyzed correctly. By this way, generalization of the study increased because there was presence of different participant variables in the sample. Different participants from different backgrounds/demographics/geographical locations took part in this research which gives a more representative sample. A wide range of subjects increases the external validity and makes the experiment relevant for more people resulting in improved generalizability of the study overall.</p>
