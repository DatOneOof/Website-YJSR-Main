                        <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>Through arduous research, scientists have created the COVID-19 vaccine. The FDA issued an emergency use authorization for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines in December 2020, merely one year after the coronavirus was discovered in December 2019. In February 2021, the Janssen vaccine was approved for emergence use.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">How Do the Covid Vaccines Work?</h2>
                        <p>The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines use mRNA technology. The mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) information from the DNA in the nucleus of the cell to ribosomes for protein synthesis. When the mRNA arrives at the ribosomes, it will attach itself to it. Then, tRNAs, or transfer ribonucleic acids, carrying amino acids to the ribosome site will read the information on the mRNA, and copy it. The amino acids of the tRNAs make a chain. Once the chain is complete, it will fold, making a protein. In the case of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, the mRNA is made in a laboratory. As the tRNA reads the mRNA, it builds a spike protein that functions like the one on the surface of the COVID-19 virus particle. After the protein is built, it is displayed on the surface of the cell. The immune system will create antibodies to fight back because it recognizes the spike protein as a foreign molecule that could cause infectious disease.</p>
                        <p>The Johnson and Johnson vaccine contains a weakened adenovirus, which has been genetically modified to act like COVID-19. The adenovirus stimulates the body to produce antibodies to fight it off. This is beneficial in that if you get a large dose of COVID-19, your body will remember the pathogen and efficiently create antibodies; it’s essentially a training session to destroy virus particles.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Effectiveness of the Vaccine</h2>
                        <p>After numerous clinical trials, the vaccine has proved to be effective. According to an article published in The New England Journal of Medicine in April 2021, the effectiveness was up to 94% after the second dose. This appears to be wonderful news, however, with people finding the need for a booster shot, a question is posed: for how long will the vaccine be effective?</p>
                        <p>A systematic review of a number of previously conducted studies was done by a group of researchers featured in The Lancet. Using this data, the researchers were able to calculate the change in the effectiveness of the vaccine. They discovered that in the duration of one to six months after vaccination, effectiveness decreased 21-0 percentage points. As a result, they concluded that as time passes, effectiveness decreases. Furthermore, the vaccine becomes less effective as the virus mutates. Scientists from The New England Journal of Medicine found the effectiveness of two doses of the vaccine against the alpha variant to be 93.7% compared to 88% for the delta variant, and 65.5% for the omicron variant. This occurs because the target to destroy will keep on moving away from what the original covid vaccine was designed to do.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">The Impact of Exercise</h2>
                        <p>Perhaps if we can’t artificially make cures, we can improve our natural defence system, the immune system. Researchers have proven that exercise helps fight the virus. Exercise aids the immune system by releasing proteins called cytokines that trigger an immune response. In one study, infected people of all demographics were divided into three categories: inactive, moderately active, and active. The inactive group exercised for 0-10 minutes a week, the moderately active group for 11-149 minutes, and the extremely active group for over 150 minutes. It was found that as exercise increased, effectiveness did as well.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>Scientists are working hard to create vaccines that can make us immune to the variants to come. But until then, the best thing we can do is get vaccinated and live a healthy lifestyle in order to give our immune systems the best chance at ridding the virus.</p>
