              Ever since the American actress Marilyn Monroe crooned to the song
              ‘Diamonds Are A Girl’s Best Friend’ way back in 1949, diamonds
              have become the symbol of love and glamour. In fact, popular
              cinema has, repeatedly, used these sparkling rocks as the backdrop
              for racy thrillers and adventures. Who does not remember the
              classic James Bond’s spy film ‘Diamonds Are Forever’, the
              unforgettable ‘Hope’ diamond in Titanic, or even the uber-cool
              necklace in Ocean’s 8? However, times are changing and so is the
              mindset of today’s generation which has begun to realize the
              unethical and harsh conditions associated with this industry,
              leading to a shift in consumer behavior. ‘Lab-grown’ or
              artificially created diamonds have emerged as a viable
              alternative, but a lot more needs to be understood before these
              can replace natural diamonds. Let’s find out.
            </p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">Collected Chronicles</h2>
            <p>
              Diamonds were first discovered in India, and it was believed that
              India was the only source for diamonds. In 1866, 15-year-old
              Erasmus Jacobs discovered the Eureka diamond, the first ever in
              South Africa. Later in 1905, Frederick Wells, who was attracted to
              a reflection while making a routine inspection, made the discovery
              of the largest diamond, Cullinan, weighing 3,106 carats. These
              discoveries led to the establishment of major extraction mines.
              With De Beers setting up their mining company in the big hole, the
              brand soon became the largest distributor who controlling more
              than 85% of the market. Today, the diamond industry globally is
              expected to increase by 10% with a value of approximately 29.2
              billion USD by 2025- 30. But now, people are also looking for
              alternatives to naturally mined diamonds such as recycled
              diamonds, carbon-negative diamonds, and lab-grown diamonds that
              are environmentally better and more affordable.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Carbon Copies</h2>
            <p>
              A lab-grown diamond has the same chemical comp o s i t i o n and
              identical physical properties to that of a mined one, with the
              only difference being that lab-grown diamonds are developed in a
              controlled environment instead of being extracted from earth’s
              resources. There are two ways in which diamonds are grown in labs.
              The first is through HPHT (High Pressure- High Temperature ),
              considered to be the original method, wherein, a small diamond
              seed is placed in carbon and exposed to extreme heat. The metal
              dissolves the high purity carbon source, and atoms precipitate on
              the diamond seed crystal and the synthetic diamond grows. The
              second method is called CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition), and this
              is a relatively newer way, where diamonds grow from a hydrocarbon
              gas mixture subjected to moderate pressures and temperature. The
              seed is placed in a vacuum chamber which is then heated. In due
              course of time, the gas turns into plasma to form a diamond.
              Currently, Indian labs are also competing well in this growing
              market, contributing 1.5 million carats of CVD diamond production,
              which is about a quarter of the estimated lab-grown diamonds
              worldwide.
            </p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">Cool Choices</h2>
            <p>
              Lab-grown diamonds are four times less expensive than natural ones
              and are affordable for many consumers as well. Carat, which is the
              measurement of the weight of a diamond, of course, affects the
              price, and the larger the carat, the more expensive the diamond
              will be. The cut, style, and clarity also matter. Apart from this,
              in-between sizes of diamonds, also referred to as ‘off size
              diamonds’, are intentionally made to offer variations on the
              traditional size for cost-cutting and saving money. Also,
              artificial diamonds can be carved into desired sizes. Noticing the
              scope and opportunity for growth, De Beers in 2018, launched its
              new line ‘Lightbox’, which are lab-grown diamonds that introduced
              pink, blue and white options at 800 USD a carat, while a mined
              equivalent would have cost 6,000 USD a carat.
            </p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">Conscience Calls</h2>
            <p>
              While it would be too early to conclude that lab-grown diamonds
              could replace the mined ones soon enough, concerns about
              environmental sustainability and social welfare are high up on the
              agenda of the new consumer. There are many reasons why one must
              opt for artificial alternatives. Firstly, these consume lesser
              water, 405 litres less water per carat than the mined ones, and
              require lesser electricity to be produced, as mined diamonds
              require 2000 times more electricity for each carat. Secondly, a
              carat from a labgrown diamond emits zero amount of sulphur oxide,
              which is fatal to the human respiratory system, while
              traditionally mined diamonds emit 13 kilograms of this deadly gas.
              The process of lab-grown diamonds also controls ‘pit mining’,
              which contributes to adverse environmental impacts such as soil
              erosion, deforestation and water pollution. Thus, one can say that
              lab grown diamonds ensure earth’s natural resources are not
              overexploited and the balance of the ecosystem is maintained.
            </p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">Clear Champion</h2>
            <p>
              One also cannot overlook the fact that natural diamonds are mostly
              being mined in war zones and sold to finance conflicts, and
              thereby profit warlords and diamond companies around the world.
              They are often produced by engaging forced labour which is
              underpaid and kept under substandard conditions. Even though, in
              2003, the industry worked towards the enforcement of the Kimberley
              Process to remove ‘blood’ or conflicted diamonds from the supply
              chain, this law is still riddled with loopholes. Thus, lab grown
              diamonds provide for a much better and safer alternative.
              Lab-created diamonds sparkle with the same brilliance, one that is
              definitely not tainted with the blood and sweat of vulnerable
              people. So, next time you are looking for a diamond, you know what
              to choose!
