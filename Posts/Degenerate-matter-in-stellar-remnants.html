                        <!-- Main Content/ Article Body -->
                        <p>Since ancient times, the numerous stars in the night sky have guided humans through their travels and thus, have always been observed as interesting subjects of study. Throughout the years, scientists have been successful in developing various approaches to studying these objects by applying the principles of physics along with the development of astronomical instruments that are used to observe them. In modern astronomy, stellar evolution is one of the very important aspects that come up whenever we talk about stars.</p>
                        <p>But what exactly happens in the last stages of a star’s life cycle? <br>This article aims to provide an introduction to the stellar remnants, namely, <i>white dwarfs</i> and <i>neutron stars</i>, and how the basic principles of the degeneracy of fermions are applied to study them.</p>
                        <p>In our Universe, the matter-based objects we know of are all made of just a few simple ingredients: protons, neutrons, and electrons. Electrons themselves are fundamental particles while the other two are composed of quarks. Both quarks and electrons in turn are fermions having half-integer spin. There are various celestial objects which are either self-luminous or non-luminous. Although white dwarfs and neutron stars fall in the latter category of celestial objects, they are also referred to as <b>Stellar Remnants</b>, meaning the last stages of a star, either before exploding as supernovae or resulting in a black hole. Theoretically, the difference between these two is that white dwarfs are the final form that stars can take before becoming neutron stars <sup>[1]</sup> and are less massive than the latter.</p>
                        <p>Now, degenerate matter refers to matter that has a sufficiently high density that the dominant contribution to its pressure rises from the Pauli Exclusion Principle. It is commonly modeled as an ideal Fermi gas, which consists of a collection of non-interacting fermions. If the gas particles are fermions (such as electrons or neutrons), then the Pauli Exclusion Principle <sup>[2]</sup> allows at most one fermion in each quantum state because no two fermions can have the same set of quantum numbers. This property is important in preventing a gravitational collapse of the stellar remnants by maintaining the electron degeneracy pressure (in the case of White Dwarfs) or neutron degeneracy pressure (in the case of Neutron Star).</p>
                        <p>It is well known that the Chandrasekhar Limit <sup>[3]</sup> of 1.4 Solar Masses is the theoretical maximum mass a white dwarf star can have and remain in that particular stage. (However, there can be some change in the value depending on the metallicity of the star). When the mass of the star exceeds this limit, the electron degeneracy pressure is not enough to prevent gravity from collapsing further. At this stage, electrons combine with protons to make neutrons and neutrinos. This results in a neutron star. Now, analogous to the Chandrasekhar Limit, there is a similar mass limit of approximately 1.5 to 3.0 solar masses applicable for the Neutron stars known as the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff or TOV limit. <sup>[4]</sup> The strong nuclear force creates a greater effective repulsion in neutron stars than it does in a simple model of degenerate, cold fermionic gases. The interiors of White dwarfs and Neutron Stars are treated as fermions (electrons and neutrons respectively) to derive these respective limits.</p>
                        <p>The maximum energy, E<sub>f</sub> of any fermion (electron or neutron) in a completely degenerate gas at temperature, T equal to 0 K is known as the Fermi energy. <sup>[5]</sup> At any temperature over absolute zero, part of the states with energies less than E<sub>f</sub> will become unoccupied as fermions spend their thermal energy to occupy states with higher energies. Although the degeneracy will not be precisely complete when T > 0 K, the assumption of complete degeneracy is a good approximation of the densities encountered in the interior of a white dwarf. All but the most energetic particles will have less energy than Fermi energy. We also know that the pressure of a gas is dependent on the momentum of the particles. The hydrostatic equilibrium of the stellar remnants, such as a white dwarf or a neutron star, is maintained by this degeneracy pressure. Now, applying these basic physical principles,  it is possible to theoretically derive the expressions for pressure. As it has been mentioned earlier, this gravitational collapse at some point reaches a certain equilibrium state depending upon the mass and the degeneracy pressure acting outwards.</p>
                        <p>The following diagrams show how they are balanced.</p>

                        <p>With the relativistic limit, the radius decreases with mass but becomes zero at a certain limit and this limit is the Chandrasekhar Limit.  It is the threshold to the maximum mass of an ideal white dwarf. The currently accepted value of the Chandrasekhar limit is about 1.4 Solar mass. Although an equilibrium is reached at this limit, the thermal energy of the white dwarfs gets depleted slowly and gradually. This energy is carried by electron conduction in the interior of the white dwarf which is nearly isothermal. Hence, here also, the degree of degeneracy plays a crucial role since the degenerate electrons travel long distances before losing any energy, and thus conduction of energy takes place. There is a significant variation of temperature only in the outer non-degenerate surface layers. Hence, On further collapse, the white dwarfs may end up as supernovae. A similar approach can be adopted to derive the TOV limit for the neutron stars. The review article by Prof. Masatsugu Sei Suzuki <sup>[7]</sup> excellently explains the mathematics involved in the derivations of these limits.</p>
                        <p>Now, as long as the fermi gas pressure in a stellar remnant can hold itself up, it can either exist as a white dwarf or neutron star. However, as the fuel gets used up, the core starts to collapse even further. This collapse can cause the production of neutrinos which are responsible for the explosion of the star in its final stage. This is known to be a supernova <sup>[8]</sup> and is classified into two broad categories: Type I and Type II. It is also notable that not all of them end up as supernovae and instead of explosions, they implode. This is mainly dependent upon how the fuel (C-12 and its isotopes) gets used up. For higher-mass giants, when the neutrinos fly off causing a blast wave that hits the outer dense matter, it prevents the explosion from happening. As a result, black holes are formed when the core implodes. Hence, it can be said that although there is complex physics involved in explaining the life cycle of a star, a lot more is yet to be explored, and continuous efforts are being made. In this article, a small effort has been made to introduce the basic physics of degenerate matter and its real-life application on the remnants of a star.</p>
