                        <p>Quantum mechanics explains the behaviour of subatomic particles, such as atoms and their subatomic constituents, which constitute all matter in the universe. A fundamental principle of this theory is the presence of significant uncertainty at this microscopic scale, unlike what is observed in larger objects. For example, in the macroscopic world, you can measure the location and velocity of a train, and so easily determine when it will reach its next station.</p>
                        <p>Let's now swap the train for an electron. Here, things shift. Now, if you know the momentum of the electron, you cannot know its precise location, and if you know the precise location, you cannot know the momentum. Instead, you can only calculate the probability of finding the electron in a specific location with a certain velocity (this can be done by either using Schrodinger’s Equation or Dirac’s Equation based on the model you have your values in). This approach provides a vague understanding of the electron's behaviour.</p>

                        <p>Okay cool. Where’s the Kinderjoy and human brain here?</p>
                        <p>Neuroscience is pertaining to the brain, where electrical impulses are controlling the actions, and futures, of humans. Electricity, which is necessary for the impulses, depends on free moving electrons or ions. In quantum physics, there are two infamous equations which help us to deduce the probability of a particle being at one place at one time, which were mentioned above. Several curious scientists started experimenting and found out that the uncertainty extends beyond the subatomic realm and influences our decision-making processes, whether we're contemplating what to watch on Netflix or choosing which doughnut to buy.</p>
                        <p>This is where quantum mechanics becomes relevant. Unlike classical decision-making theories, the quantum world accommodates a certain level of... uncertainty.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Classical Reinforcement Theory and Pavlov’s Dog</h2>
                        <p>In traditional psychology, they believe that people make choices to get more good things and avoid bad things. They call it "reinforcement learning," and it's like when you learn from your past experiences and predict what will happen next. It's a bit like Pavlov's dog, you know, how they learned to expect certain things based on what happened before.</p>
                        <img class="illus-img" src="../assets/others/qubits_kinderjoy_and_the_human_brain_kavya (1).png">
                        <p class="img-cap"><b>Figure 3:</b> Representation of Pavlog's Dog</p>
                        <p>But here's the thing: real-life isn't always that straightforward. People don't always weigh the pros and cons of a situation and make a rational decision. Nope, our emotions and personal feelings get in the way. Sometimes we let our subjective feelings about a situation mess with our ability to make clear-headed choices. It's like our gut feeling or instincts have a say in what we decide.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">To Know Or Not to Know</h2>
                        <p>Let’s assume we’re playing a game. It’s heads or tails: if it lands on heads you get 10 dollars, but if it lands on tails you need to pay 10 dollars. You get to flip the coin twice.</p>
                        <p>You flip the coin once. It’s heads, and you won 10 dollars. When asked for a second flip, it’s very likely that you will make the second flip because you are confident, and want to earn more. Now, let’s go back 10 seconds and assume it was tails, and you lost 10 dollars. When asked again, you most probably will make the second flip, just so you can recover your previous loss.</p>
                        <p>Let’s rewind once again. This time, I did not tell you the result of the first flip. I’m asking you if you want to have the second flip. What will you say?</p>
                        <p>It’s most likely a no, or at least you were reluctant. But think about it, does knowing or not knowing really make a difference?</p>
                        <p>When known, the first flip does not sway the choice that follows, but when unknown, it makes all the difference. This paradox does not fit within the framework of classical reinforcement learning, which predicts that the objective choice should always be the same. In contrast, quantum mechanics takes uncertainty into account and actually predicts this odd outcome.</p>
                        <p>In fact, there is a name given to the state when the result of the flip could have been a head or a tail- it was basically both a head and a tail at the same time. This phenomenon is called Superposition.</p>
                        <p>Hey, you know what's cool? Quantum mechanics also recognizes something interesting about how people make decisions. It says that our beliefs about what will happen, whether it's going to be awesome or a total disaster, actually influence what we end up choosing. It's like our thoughts and decisions get all tangled up together, forming this crazy connection. Our beliefs and our actions become best buddies, always hanging out together. In scientific terms, they are entangled.</p>
                        <p>Even those itty-bitty subatomic particles can get tangled up and mess with each other's behaviour, even if they're on opposite sides of the world! For example, if you're in Japan and you measure one of those particles, its buddy in the United States will feel the effects.</p>
                        <p>Now, here's where things get really wild. In psychology, we can draw a similar comparison between our beliefs and our actions. It's like they're BFFs who always have each other's backs. Our beliefs and behaviours are so entangled that they affect each other. <br>And get this, they even use fancy words like "measurement outcome" and "quantum probability" to explain it all. But basically, it just means that the way we think affects what we end up doing. But Kavya, isn’t that obvious?</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">It is How it Is</h2>
                        <p>In the classical world, it isn’t (and people think the quantum world is the illogical one!). Classical psychology takes into account only the pros and cons when choosing between some options. That is just too simple to explain the decision making in the minds of humans. Quantum calculations, on the other hand, are more complex and take into account most factors that can affect one choice. Which is why it is the world of probabilities with loads of uncertainty. So, even not getting your preferred toy in Kinder Joy can affect your college decisions. Weird, but it is how it is.</p>
                        <p>When you come to think about it, everything, every factor, is represented as a wave amplitude (according to the Quantum theory). When you have several of these waves, the amplitudes interact. It may be constructive or destructive. It will require the power of a Quantum computer to calculate what the final amplitude - that is the final outcome, might be. It can vary on extreme scales.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Is it Biologically Possible?</h2>
                        <p>Let's resonate with a quote from the infamous movie Oppenheimer, “That’s only how far theory will take you”. Theoretically, a qubit infused brain is possible.</p>
                        <p>But how? Quantum computers need to be kept at temperatures around 0 Kelvin, and far from any mechanical disturbance. How can those qubits exist in the insanely cacophonic surroundings that our brain thrives in?</p>
                        <p>In the biochemical setting, electric fields tend to be the primary culprits causing decoherence for the nuclei with bigger spins. The nuclei with half-integer spins are chill – they get slightly decohered by magnetic fields. This was proved through an experiment conducted on rats where 2 isotopes of Lithium, <sup>6</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> and <sup>7</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> were used. <sup>6</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> has a spin of 1.5, and a coherence time of about 10 seconds, while <sup>7</sup>Li<sup>+</sup> has a spin of 0.5 and a coherence time of as long as 5 minutes!</p>
                        <p>So yes, any atom with the spin of 0.5 is barely affected by external disturbances. Among the popular biochemical elements like carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulphur, and the ions Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Cl<sup>-</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and Ca<sup>2+</sup>, hydrogen aside, only phosphorus has a nucleus with that special half-integer spin value.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">What’s Next?</h2>
                        <p>Well, book your calendars for the day when a ‘hacker’ uses their quantum computer and breaks into your mind, steals data from your head, such as your passwords, deepest secrets and the place where you hid the test paper you got an F in.</p>
                        <p>Just kidding. If a day such is ever to come, it will be at least 200 years after this article was released. The reason for that is that Quantum computers aren't developed enough yet. They can’t even break the RSI encryption yet, and give more errors than you must have in your entire life. So calm down, sip some coffee, and burn that test paper.</p>
