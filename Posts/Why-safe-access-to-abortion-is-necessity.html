                        <h2 class="section-heading">What is abortion?</h2>
                        <p>In medicine, the word abortion is used to refer to the act of terminating a pregnancy, usually deliberately. In case the pregnancy ends unintentionally, it is referred to as a miscarriage. This may be done by the consumption of specific drugs or by a surgical procedure. Many internal and external factors can cause a miscarriage.</p>
                        <p>The recent overturning of Roe v. Wade in the US has sparked many debates on the topic of abortion and its moral, legal and health implications. This is my take on the Pro-choice Vs Pro-life debate along with a string of medical backup and resources that you might need to educate yourself about this topic.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Difference between abortion and infanticide:</h2>
                        <p>A lot of the time, the terms abortion and infanticide are used interchangeably which leads to many stigmas surrounding the act of intentional abortion.</p>
                        <p>Infanticide refers to the act of killing a baby/infant within a year of its birth, while abortion is performed on a foetus or embryo while they are in the womb.</p>
                        <p>One should keep in mind that a fetus and embryo are not the same as an Infant. One of the conditions for a living human to qualify as an infant is that it needs to be born alive.</p>
                        <p>So, going by the definition, infanticide isn't the same as an abortion.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Effects of pregnancy on a woman</h2>
                        <p>As soon as fertilization takes place, changes start occurring in the mother's body. Several changes occur in the carrier's body throughout pregnancy.</p>
                        <p>The fetus isn't an individual capable of developing on its own outside its carrier's body. Its nutritional requirements are met through the mother's blood which is exchanged through the placenta via the umbilical cord. This causes a lot of problems relating to the woman's health including anaemia.</p>
                        <p>Pregnant women are susceptible to UTIs and other infections. Regular morning sickness, nausea, swollen feet, and hormonal imbalances go without saying.</p>
                        <p>Women with polycystic ovary syndrome have to face many complications in case they get pregnant and decide to continue with it. These complications include high blood pressure and gestational diabetes.</p>
                        <p>Apart from physical side effects, pregnancy can also take a toll on the woman's mental health. Women with pre-existing medical illnesses may experience heightened symptoms.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Why abortion?</h2>
                        <p>One might get an abortion due to medical complications or personal choice. Sometimes the child the parent is carrying might have a genetic disorder that can lead to lifelong conditions without cures. Sometimes the fetus may not properly develop and again lead to a tough life for it if it takes birth.</p>
                        <p>Another reason is sexual assault-induced pregnancies. At times, a girl or woman might be too young to give birth or incapable of raising a child. She might not have the financial resources to do so, or simply she doesn't wish to be a mother and that should be enough of a reason for her to get an abortion.</p>
                        <p>The majority of the time putting the baby up for adoption is considered an alternative, disregarding the fact that foster care isn't as great as it seems. The foster parents might be abusive to the child. Most of the time, children have an unstable childhood, moving from one foster home to another. Not to mention the fact that some countries don't have a foster care system in place and not all kids get adopted.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Why be Pro-Choice?</h2>
                        <p>The same people who were against the idea of a government forcing them to take a vaccine for their safety, are taking the stance of "Pro-life".</p>
                        <p>They say it's "murder." <br>But here's the thing, if abortion is murder then so is the release of sperm from a man's body because of masturbation. Murder is defined as the act of intentionally killing an individual. In defence, people might say that a fetus is alive or that it has the potential to grow into a human being, but so does sperm.</p>
                        <p>We can't define something by its potential to grow into something else. An acorn might become a tree but as long as it doesn't grow into one, it's still an acorn.</p>
                        <p>A fetus can't grow independently. It needs to be in the womb of a carrier and it causes more harm than good to the woman carrying it. It can take weeks and even months for her body to go back to normal after delivery. People should have the right to do whatever they want with their bodies and the government shouldn't tell people what to do with them. Women too are people.</p>
                        <p>Moreover criminalising abortion isn't going to stop it from happening. Rich people will always have access to it while the financially weaker section might have to take resolve to illegal and unsafe abortion. Safe access to abortion is a reproductive and thus human right!</p>
                        <p>I'll list the resources you might need to educate yourself in the reference section.</p>
