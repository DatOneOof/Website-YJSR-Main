                        <p>How can negative thinking affect your actions and performance? As people, we have an inner voice inside us, which can help guide thoughts and beliefs. Sometimes, this voice can be beneficial, for example, by allowing individuals to choose healthier meal options instead of junk food. However, this voice can also be detrimental, especially when it is excessively negative. A negative voice can contribute to mental illness, such as lack of motivation, distraction, and poor self-esteem. The negative thought often stems from a situation that can lead to catastrophizing and ruminating over the event. The problem with negative thinking is that it can hinder a person’s ability to achieve goals, because they live under the belief that they cannot accomplish the task. It is often tricky to break this cycle, since one may not even realize they are participating in negative thinking. It contributes to internal biases, and only affirms the thought that already exists. However, there are some ways to break out of this cycle and regain self-esteem. First, a person must stop negative thoughts in the inner voice- recognizing when the thoughts come out and what they can do. After taking hold of this voice, allow yourself to feel those emotions and thoughts that do not make up a person. They aren’t real. A journal can prove beneficial in this instance, and one can write down the number of times they feel down. The journal helps track mood patterns when the inner voice comes out. The second part is utilizing self-discipline, and setting a limit on the inner voice that arises. As soon as the person spots the inside voice, they should shut it off at its core and try to resolve the thought by saying it out loud or writing it down. Distorted thinking can be replaced with healthier thoughts that can help you for the rest of your life. Positive thinking can remove stress, depression, anxiety, and poor physical health and strengthen the weakened immune system.</p>
                        <p>After discussing how mental health can be beneficial, the COVID-19 pandemic has certainly impacted mental wellbeing. The uncertainty, trauma, and illness that this disease has brought affected many individuals. But with the COVID-19 pandemic going away slowly, a return to before COVID has been possible. The existing research behind COVID-19 and youth mental health is that experts unanimously agree about its negative ramifications. Around October 2021, a youth mental health crisis again. Two of the most common mental conditions include Major Depressive Disorder and the family of Anxiety Disorders. Erasing the stigma around mental health treatment has enabled conversations about vulnerability and problems. However, the treatments for mental conditions vary between each patient at best. Selective Serotonin Uptakers and Inhibitors use serotonin to help alleviate symptoms of mental illnesses. While these can be effective, these medications only work for about 50-70 percent of people. Many others may not respond to the prescriptions available to consumers. New studies are being conducted on Electromagnetic Radiation for treatment-resistant depression, as well as on drugs that serve its effect. Treatment-resistant mental illness is unfortunately real, and patients suffering from mental illness need help. Furthermore, SSRIs and SSNIs can also cause some side effects- including dizziness and nausea. Humanity is lucky to be living in a time where scientific inventions are creating positive change.</p>
