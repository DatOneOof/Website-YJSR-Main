                        <p>Albert Einstein gave the theory of relativity. We recognize how gravity works and the essence of space-time because of him. With the help of the theory of relativity, we can say that gravity warps the space-time fabric. As a result, that is how we feel the effect of gravity.</p>
                        <p>Later that year, in 1921, German scientist Theodor Kaluza proposed that if gravity warps space-time, then all the other forces, such as electromagnetic or nuclear forces, should also warp space-time. Aside from that, he also concluded that maybe these forces do not warp the space-time of this dimension but warp the space of other dimensions, so, from there, theories of other dimensions (string theory) come into existence.  Kaluza–Klein theory (KK theory) is considered an important precursor to string theory. It is also known as a classical unified field theory of gravitation and electromagnetism built around the idea of a fifth dimension beyond the common 4D of space and time.</p>
                        <p>According to string theory, all objects in our universe are made up of vibrating filaments (and membranes) of energy. It suggests that subatomic particles are made up of sub-sub-subatomic strings. When we zoom in on the particles, what we usually think of as small pool table balls turn out to be tiny loops or lengths from a more primitive substance. Such strings vibrate like tiny string instruments, with each particle representing a different range. These strings come in two forms — closed strings and open strings. A closed string is a loop with no open ends, whereas an open string has ends that do not touch.</p>
                        <p>According to this theory, as the early universe cooled after the big bang, this unified force began to disintegrate into the various forces we see today. Experiments at high energies may one day allow us all to detect the unification of these forces, although these experiments are far beyond our existing technological capabilities. String theory attempts to unify the four forces in the universe: the electromagnetic force,  strong nuclear force, weak nuclear force, and gravity — together into one unified theory. In our universe, these fundamental forces appear as four different phenomena, but string theory believes that in the early universe, like the time of the big bang, these forces were described by strings interacting with each other.</p>
                        <p>String theory, as a mathematical result, only makes sense in a universe with much more than three space dimensions. (Our universe has three dimensions of space, which are X, Y and Z axis.) The extra dimensions are curled up to incredibly small sizes, so we never perceive them. The universe we know is a four-dimensional surface in a ten-dimensional space.</p>
                        <p>Another of the most unexpected and disturbing discoveries of string theory is that, rather than one single theory, there could be a large number of different theories. The Anthropic principle is one of the most controversial aspects of modern string theory, which tries to explain properties of our universe as a result of our presence in it.</p>
                        <p>According to certain interpretations of string theory, our universe may not be the only one. In fact, in the most extreme versions of the theory, an infinite number of other universes exist, some of which contain exact duplicates of our own universe. As Einstein’s theory of relativity predicts warped space called a wormhole, string theory allows for the possibility that wormholes extend not only between distant regions of our own universe, but also between distant regions of parallel universes. Wormholes could possibly connect universes with different physical laws.</p>
                        <p>One issue with string theory is that, instead of the eighteen fundamental particles in the Standard Model, supersymmetry necessitates at least 36 fundamental particles that have yet to be explored. Another setback for string theory is that it does not predict the existence of dark energy.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps universes with different physical laws might even be linked by wormholes. String theory provides many intriguing topics for thought, but you may be curious to know about its relevance today. String theory, as scientists believe, might be the next step in our expanding grasp of the universe. Thus, only time will tell whether string theory is right or factually inaccurate, but regardless of the answer, string theory has driven scientists for years to ask critical questions about our universe and explore the findings in new directions.</p>
