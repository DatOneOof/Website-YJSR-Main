                        <h2 class="section-heading">What are Macular Degeneration and Retinitis Pigmentosa?</h2>
                        <p>
                            Also known as Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD), Macular Degeneration is a chronic eye disease that causes severe vision problems. It develops when the macula, a small central area of the retina, wears out. The degeneration of the macula releases the densely packed photoreceptor cells into the eye, which eventually disappear, causing blurred central vision. AMD is most prominent in adults over the age of 60. Some risk factors of AMD include:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Smoking</li>
                                <li>High blood pressure</li>
                                <li>High cholesterol</li>
                                <li>Obesity</li>
                                <li>Light-colored eyes</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>AMD is also genetically linked, so if someone in your family has it, the chances of also having the disease are higher.</p>
                        <p>Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) is a genetic condition that leads to the gradual loss of vision. This is due to photoreceptor cells in the retina that break down over time.</p>
                        <p>RP initially affects the rods in the outer ring of the retina, which causes a deficiency in one’s night and peripheral vision.  With over 60 genes that influence RP, there are several classifications of it, which has made it difficult to cure.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Past and Current Research</h2>
                        <p>Researchers have discovered a promising solution to AMD and RP: an existing drug known as disulfiram, which has been marketed under the brand name Antabuse. This drug has previously been used to treat alcoholism. A research study was tested on laboratory mice, and the results were promising. Researchers found disulfiram to be effective in restoring some vision because it suppressed sensory “noise” caused by the dying rods in the retina. Sensory signals blocked pose a fundamental problem for information processing. However, with disulfiram present, strong sensory sensations can diminish and allow clear vision.</p>
                        <p>Three years ago, researchers demonstrated that sensory noise will only increase when photoreceptors (rods and cones) in the inner retina stop functioning. When these photoreceptors die, the retina is flooded with retinoic acid. The rods and cones are packed with rhodopsin, which contains the compound retinaldehyde. Once the retinaldehyde is no longer absorbed by the rods and cones, it is converted into retinoic acid. Sensory noise is the direct effect of a retinoic acid build-up. By inhibiting the retinoic acid receptor with disulfiram, the past research study proved that disulfiram reduced sensory noise and increased light avoidance behaviors in the mice.</p>
                        <p>In a new study, researchers took the information from the previous study a step further. After giving mice a dose of disulfiram, scientists inserted a fluorescent protein indicator to examine the mice’s brain cell response to complex visuals, namely a movie clip. Treated mice with retinitis pigmentosa produced a much stronger visionary response compared to mice that weren’t treated. The chemicals in disulfiram interfered with the retinoic acid receptor and retinaldehyde dehydrogenase, the enzyme that stimulates the production of retinoic acid, which ultimately allowed the brain to block the signal of sensory noise.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Side Effects</h2>
                        <p>
                            Researchers acknowledged that there may be some drawbacks in administering this drug. Some side effects include:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Eye pain due to change in vision</li>
                                <li>Mood or mental disruptions</li>
                                <li>Numbness, tingling, pain, or weakness in hands or feet</li>
                                <li>Drowsiness</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>While it can improve vision, disulfiram interferes with alcohol breakdown and other metabolic functions. Researchers have foreseen this as a problem and have tested an experimental drug known as BMS 493. Through gene therapy, this drug can be taken to block retinoic acid receptors and the RARS1 gene, which codes for alcohol compounds. Testing for BMS 493 has proven to improve vision in mice with RP and has yet to have any severe side effects.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>Based on behavioral and brain imaging results, disulfiram improves vision. Treatment with disulfiram decreased the production of retinoic acid and increased the image-processing ability of nearly-blind mice. The introduction of disulfiram to treat AMD and RP is a hopeful solution for these chronic eye diseases.</p>
