                        <p>It has been years since the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) firstly detected gravitational waves from a black-hole merger, which spiralled into the creation of a whole new branch of observational science known as gravitational-wave astronomy. [1] And that was just the beginning. Since then, the LIGO earned 3 Nobel Prizes, detected more than 50 gravitational waves and inspired several projects of the future such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) or the Japanese KAGRA project. [2] [3] 
                        <br><br> So what did we learn so far? <br><br>It all began almost a century before the first detection, when Albert Einstein in his general theory of relativity first predicted the existence of gravitational waves. However, for the next hundred years, this was only a speculation as gravitational waves were only inferred in indirect manners. [4] Until now scientists relied on electromagnetic radiation or subatomic particles known as neutrinos to learn about exotic objects in the universe. However, the problem with using electromagnetic waves is that they can be absorbed, refracted, or bent and therefore the information they carry can be altered. [5] Gravitational waves, on the other hand, travel through spacetime unimpeded which provides a clearer view of high energy events in the universe. Therefore, gravitational-wave astronomy can be used to locate events or cosmic objects before light-based telescopes.<br><br>Several science projects of the past such as the BICEP2 telescope which searched for imprints of gravitational waves in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) or Arecibo Observatory which observed two pulsars moving closer to each other and for this to happen gravitational waves had to be emitted. And even though these ideas resulted in several Nobel prizes, there was no direct observation of this phenomena until 2015. [4][6]. On September 14 at exactly 09:50:45 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), the two interferometers in Livingston and Hanford simultaneously detected a gravitational wave signal. [7] Since then, there have been several detections of gravitational waves from binary black hole systems and even a binary neutron star merger. [8]<br><br>In order for LIGO to be able to directly detect gravitational waves, it requires a great level of precision. It is based on the system of interferometers which create an interference pattern by merging several sources of light and therefore make it measurable. A laser beam is split and sent into two directions in which on both sides there is a vacuum tube with a reflective surface at the end. The distances are precisely the same and therefore, when the light waves from the laser are reflected, they interfere in a destructive way and cancel each other out. This changes when a gravitational wave is detected. Since gravitational waves are ripples in the spacetime fabric and distort spacetime, they cause the arms of the interferometer to move in a motion described as differential displacement. Thus, one arm gets longer while the other gets simultaneously shorter, which results in changes in the distance the laser beams have to travel. When the distances are not equal, the waves will no longer cancel each other out and a signal will be detected. [9] These changes in distances can be as small as 10-19 m which makes it extremely challenging to measure considering conditions such as earthquakes or any form of natural events.<br><br>These detections are fascinating for almost an infinite amount of reasons. We know that gravitational waves are formed from very energetic events in the universe such as collisions, mergers and explosions of massive stars. So far gravitational waves were used to study neutron stars which shed some light on the origin of several heavy metals. Elements such as gold were predicted to be created with the explosions of supernovae. However, observing the gravitational waves from a neutron star merger showed that it is rather an explosion of a neutron star which results in the production of extremely high amounts of heavy metals. This suggests that for example the gold that can be found on Earth was produced by a merger of neutron stars billions of years ago. [10]<br><br>The future is even more captivating. Not only are there major improvements in the precision of the measurements but there is also a proposed project known as Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). It greatly differs from LIGO, Virgo or any of the observatories so far. While they are all ground based, LISA is a space probe whose purpose is going to be to detect gravitational waves from further systems or bodies with smaller stellar masses. It is planned to be sent to space by the European Space Agency in the upcoming years. [11] Perhaps if we took it a step further, gravitational waves have the potential to allow us to learn about the most energetic event in the universe, the Big Bang. Data from LISA and other projects of the future will hopefully be able to fill in the blanks regarding the primordial gravitational waves formed within the first second after the big bang. Which combined with the information astronomers gained from years of observing the CMB can bring us a step closer to solving the one most fascinating mysteries of the universe.
