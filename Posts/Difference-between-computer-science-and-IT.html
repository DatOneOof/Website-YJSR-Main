                        <p>Choosing between computer science and information technology as a future career field will make some people get confused. Because to the average person, computer science and information technology might seem like different names for the same thing. It might be because of both fields dealing with computing. As a person who is interested in both spheres, it is worth evaluating the career fields, workplaces they will lead. Although they bear superficial similarities, the difference between computer science and information technology are striking.</p>
                        <p>To begin with, one of the obvious similarities they share is that according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), Information Technology (IT) and Computer Science are currently experiencing a “much faster than average” growth rate. For example, over 600,000 new jobs are expected to be added in this sector between 2021 and 2031 <i>(Computer and Information Technology Occupations)</i>. That means, scientists of both fields’ can be found in many different working environments, including academia, research, industries, government and business organizations.</p>
                        <p>Another similarity is this, computer scientists and information technology experts have overlap in educational background. Due to this, there are some jobs like computer analyst or database administrator that are available to people with either an IT or computer science degree. The skills in some programming languages like Python, HTML and Database tools like SQL, Excel are common in both field’s experts <i>(Computer Science vs. Information Technology: Careers, Degrees, and More)</i>.  In simple terms, both sphere’s professionals will learn basic and advanced software development.</p>
                        <p>In spite of these similarities, these two fields are very different because of the complexity of issues they address, and the workspace they will work in. <br>One obvious difference is in the issues they address. Generally, computer science refers to designing and building computers and computer programs. It is a broad field that focuses on understanding and using algorithmic and mathematical processes that are applied to computer systems. On the other hand, information technology refers to maintaining and troubleshooting those computers and their networks, and databases to ensure they run smoothly <i>(IT vs. Computer Science: How to Decide on the Right Tech Degree)</i>. Put simply, computer scientists design and develop software programs that IT professionals use and maintain.</p>
                        <p>Other areas of their differences include the curriculum and the workplace. Computer science experts are more likely to become a software engineer or software developer because, as we have stated earlier, they will have coursework more focused on advanced mathematics. In contrast, majoring in IT will lead to having courses on project and business communication management, so this field’s experts are more likely to be employed in situations that require working collaboratively in teams, designing and modifying systems to meet a company’s or individual’s needs. (Abraham). In other words, IT professionals usually are part of team work, whereas computer science experts typically will end up working individually.</p>
                        <p>To sum up, the future is promising for both computer science and IT professionals as technology is becoming more integrated in society. Being familiar with the similarities and the differences they share, it will be easier to choose or find which one is optimum for you. Personally, considering all the information above, I realized that computer science more fits my desires about future career.</p>
