                        <!-- Main Content/ Article Body -->
                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p>Vegetarians have a huge struggle in this world. As we all know, keto dieting has become all the rage as a way to lose weight and being healthier. It is a diet that calls for fat to replace carbohydrates in the form of ketones in the liver to provide energy to the body (Harvard Medical School, 2020). However, it has been advertised as more of a non-veg diet, which draws vegetarians away from the diet. This leads to people not taking advantage of a valuable opportunity that can completely change their life meaningfully. This is why people need to know that keto dieting can be for vegetarians. With the willpower to take appropriate measures in this type of keto program, one can definitely achieve his or her health goals.</p>
                        <h2>Diet Pathways</h2>
                        <p>There are three diet paths one can take in this keto program. There is the one-meal diet path, two-meal path, and three-meal path. The one-meal and two-meal path force one to shift away from eating for taste instead of just eating to satisfy hunger. The three-meal path is only for those who want to gain weight. These individuals should consume 120-150 grams of fat per day. If one feels hungry even after a 3rd meal, then a 4th meal can be a valid option. Some other things to know about are that one has to take an Omega3 tablet during the afternoons and evenings. Fat is suggested to be consumed in liquids like water, tea without sugar, and bulletproof coffee. The fat in bulletproof coffee can keep people energetic throughout the day while supporting diet goals (Dr. Berg, 2017). Fat should only be taken 10-15 g at one time. Nuts are encouraged (0-10 per day), and cheese can be allowed to an extent of 100 g per day. Onions, tomatoes, and carrots are encouraged (1 of each per day). People who will follow the vegetarian keto diet for diabetes should consume 5 spoons of a sesame seed, 2 spoons curd with 1 liter of water with lemon (no salt should be added). These people should not consume any fruits.</p>
                        <h2>Main Pillars</h2>
                        <p>There are four main pillars of this vegetarian diet. The first one involves individuals taking 70-100g of fat in the first 10 days of the program. After 10 days, individuals should fall back down to take 50-70g of fat. Fat is very important in the keto diet as it can be the main source of energy for a person as glucose and carbs are taken out of the equation (Franciscan Health, 2018). The second pillar involves individuals consuming 2 fresh lemons in the morning and 2 in the evening in juice form. If one cannot consume juice, then buttermilk will be a viable alternative. Lemon juice is vital for a keto diet as ketosis produces a high amount of uric acid and lemon juice can dissolve that acid to prevent kidney problems and a pH imbalance (Dr.Berg, 2017). The third pillar involves consuming at least 4 liters of water a day. The fourth pillar involves taking one multivitamin tablet (to regain the magnesium, potassium, and calcium that can be lost in a keto diet) and 1 or 2 Omega-3 fish oil tablets, along with Potassium Citrate tablets. Especially, for vegetarians, B-complex tablets are encouraged. Omega-3 tablets can help one achieve the right fat ratio and help prevent weight gain (MedicalNewsToday, 2019). Potassium Citrate can help reduce the chance of kidney stones by alkalinizing urine. B-complex tablets are another good source of lost vitamins in the keto diet.</p>
                        <h2>Supplemental Information</h2>
                        <p>There are some extra points that people need to consider. Sunflower oil and any refined oil are strictly prohibited from this diet. These kinds of oils can damage one’s health and cause illnesses like cancer even though they will put people into ketosis (Insider, 2020). Coconut oil and olive oil are allowed. MCT oil is very much encouraged in keto dieting because it stimulates brain function and is not as processed as other types of oils (Forbes, 2022). In the initial stages of keto dieting, people can feel tired and not alert, so MCT oil can help people get through the initial struggles of keto dieting. Vegetables such as potatoes, beetroot, raw banana, green/white beans, and broad/kidney beans should not be consumed in the diet. Rice is a big no-no. Rice has too many carbohydrates. Milk is also not encouraged (not buttermilk) as there can be an intake of too many carbohydrates. One should ban soft drinks and habits like alcohol and smoking from his or her life when participating in this program. Garlic should be used whenever possible to add flavor.</p>
                        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>During one’s participation in this diet program, one can feel uncomfortable and even frustrated because of the shift. One may even experience headaches on day one, but those headaches will eventually go away. Participants should strive to keep hope and persevere to be the best versions of themselves.</p>
