                        <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>As racial health disparities become more prevalent topics of debate among politicians in the United States, the scientific literature studying the gaps in health among various racial and ethnic groups continues to grow. With the recent COVID-19 pandemic, racial health disparities have become magnified as news articles began highlighting the vast differences in the rate of infection across key demographics in rural and urban America. In an article published in the Journal of Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities, researchers studied the mutually exclusive risk factors of COVID-19 infection and death rate among ethnic groups. They discovered that the ethnic group most susceptible to infection was African Americans, with 1,981 cases of infection among African Americans and 658 cases of infection among Whites per million (Abedi et al., 2021).  Additionally, African Americans had the highest death rate due to COVID-19 among the ethnic groups examined, with 211 deaths per million, followed by Latinos, with 82 deaths per million, Whites with 76 deaths per million, then Asians with 52 deaths per million (Abedi et al., 2021).  As witnessed during the COVID-19 pandemic, African American individuals were disproportionately affected and had higher rates of infection and mortality when compared to other ethnic groups. While there are other determinants of health to consider when synthesizing COVID-19 data among ethnic groups, it is undeniable that the inordinate gaps between the health of African Americans and other ethnic groups accentuate the fractures of the United States healthcare system. The COVID-19 pandemic, however, is not the only instance in which racial health disparities can be clearly observed. In the United States, there are significant racial health disparities in the mortality rate of cancer, infant mortality rates, and general population health among adults who live in rural locations.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">How Politics Can Affect Racial Health Disparities</h2>
                        <p>The political philosophy of the party in power at all branches of government will essentially determine how Americans live and the resources that are available to them. Therefore the legislation politicians pass often has short-term and long-term effects on everyday American citizens.  In an article published in the Journal of Social Sciences and Medicine on Population Health, researchers study the relationship between partisan politics and infant health, particularly infant mortality rates (IMR) among ethnic groups, and how certain political philosophies and presidential administrations, such as those of the republican and democratic party, have affected those rates.</p>
                        <p>The research article by Rodriguez (2019) hypothesized that republican and socially-conservative presidential administrations would drastically impact IMR and therefore increase racial health disparities in IMRs. In order to test the hypothesis, data from various health statistic networks were collected, such as data from the U.S. Census Bureau, Bureau of Labor Statistics, National Vital Statistics, and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, among other relevant sources (Rodriguez, 2019). The variables collected and analyzed included only those pertinent to infant mortality and racial health disparities according to the currently available scientific literature. Results from the study demonstrated a clear overall lack of public health improvement under Republican leadership. Infant mortality rates experienced a decreasing trend under Democratic presidents and an increasing trend under republican presidents (Rodriguez, 2019).  The findings also showed a strong association between socially-conservative philosophy and slower declines in infant mortality rates for both white and black infants when compared to a socially-liberal philosophy. Researchers concluded that approximately 46% of the white-black infant mortality gap and an additional 20,000 infant deaths could be “attributed to the 28 years of republican administrations” during the study's time period (Rodriguez, 2019).</p>
                        <p>The results of the study align with the history of public health in the United States and its continued politicization in the modern age. Exploring the relationship between partisan politics and health is integral to understanding racial health disparities because it demonstrates the influence politics has over health outcomes for all ethnic groups. While racial health disparities primarily exist between people of color, such as Black, Latino, and Asian Americans, the data demonstrated slower declines in IMR for both Black and White infants under Republican leadership. Therefore, while people of color in America may face greater adversity in achieving their desired health outcomes under the leadership of certain political ideologies, White Americans experience similar health trends but to an often lesser extent.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Racial Health Disparities in Cancer Mortality and Incidence Rates</h2>
                        <p>While the United States has experienced a decline in cancer incidence since the 1990s, Black Americans continue to have the highest mortality rate of cancer, along with the shortest survival times, when compared to any other ethnic group besides Native Americans (O’Keefe et al., 2015). An article published in the Frontiers in Public Health Journal explores racial health disparities in overall cancer mortality and specific cancer mortality rates for lung, colorectal, female breast, and prostate cancer. Between the years 2000 and 2010, Black men had overall higher cancer mortality rates than White men, with an overall age-adjusted mortality rate of 288.3 per 100,000 versus 216.7 per 100,000 for White men (O’Keefe et al., 2015). While cancer incidence rates for women were lower, Black women had a higher age-adjusted mortality rate than White women, with an age-adjusted mortality rate of 180.6 per 100,000 compared to 155 per 100,000 for White women (O’Keefe et al., 2015).</p>
                        <p>Data for the review study of lung, colorectal, female breast, and prostate cancer was gathered using cancer incidence and mortality rate data from the National Cancer Institute’s SEER program  (O’Keefe et al., 2015). Among lung cancer incidence and mortality rates, Black men continued to have the highest rate of incidence then when compared to White men. However, white men had higher lung cancer incidence rates than Black women. This observation accurately reflects the historical differences between smoking behaviors among the sexes  (O’Keefe et al., 2015). Between the years 2000 and 2009, White women experienced a small decline in incidence rates of breast cancer at approximately 1%, but Black women experienced a slight increase in breast cancer incidence rates at approximately 0.7% (O’Keefe et al., 2015). Although the rate of mortality for breast cancer has declined over recent decades, which can be attributed to advancements in treatment and early diagnosis, this decline has been much slower for Black women than White women. For instance, during the years 2000 and 2008, White women had a 90% five-year survival for breast cancer incidence, compared to Black women, who only had 78% (O’Keefe et al., 2015). Among the data for prostate cancer, African-American and Jamaican men of African Descent had the “highest prostate cancer incidence worldwide” (O’Keefe et al., 2015). Additionally, Black men had the highest mortality rate compared to other ethnic groups and a mortality rate 2.5 times greater than that of White men. However, between the years 2000 and 2009, Black men experienced a faster decrease in the mortality rate for prostate cancer than when compared to white men, with an average of 3.7% decrease for Black men and an average of 3.4% decrease for White men. Finally, among the data for colorectal cancer incidence and mortality rates, both Black men and women received values that were 22-23% higher than White men and women. However, racial differences between where cancer is likely to develop between White and Black men and women exist, such as cancer development in the colon is more likely to occur in Black individuals and cancer development in the rectum is more likely to occur in White individuals (O’Keefe et al., 2015). As the identification and detection of cancerous lesions in the colon are far more difficult to do in the colon than the rectum, this puts Black individuals at an increased risk for developing advanced colorectal cancer than White individuals.</p>
                        <p>As seen across the various data on cancer incidence and mortality rates, Black individuals are disproportionately affected and often have the highest rates of incidence and mortality when compared to White individuals. Although certain cancers have experienced significant declines in incidence and mortality rates, these trends are not often reflected among Black populations or at least not to the same extent as White populations. However, gaps in health outcomes between the two ethnic groups are starting to slowly close, as demonstrated by the data on prostate cancer and Black men experiencing a decreasing rate 0.3% faster than White men.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Examining the Relationship Between Health and Race Among Rural Americans</h2>
                        <p>When compared to urban communities, rural communities tend to have poor health outcomes, which may be attributed to the general lack of diversity in rural communities and less access to essential and specialized healthcare services. The majority of research on rural health focuses on the disparities between urban and rural populations and very rarely focuses on the health among strictly rural communities. However, an article published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention explores the racial health disparities among selected rural areas in the United States.</p>
                        <p>Data were self-reported and collected from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System to identify racial health disparities, access to healthcare services, and health-related behaviors across rural communities within all 50 states (James et al., 2017). The study relied on the Urban-Rural Classification Scheme for Counties from the National Center for Health Statistics to assess county rurality and focused primarily on adults living in these rural communities (James et al., 2017). Results found that besides Asian/Pacific Islanders, more minority and ethnic groups reported their health as “fair” or “poor,” that they were obese, and that they were unable to meet with a physician in the past year due to financial strain (James et al., 2017). Additionally, minority groups were less likely to report having a personal healthcare provider than non-Hispanic Whites (James et al., 2017).</p>
                        <p>Though people in rural communities are more likely to have worse health outcomes than people in urban communities, the racial minorities that make up rural communities demonstrate substantial health and access to healthcare. The results of the study show that important disparities are overlooked when considering only rural data at the population level. The results also indicate that regardless of race or ethnic group, all populations will endure health problems, differing only in the nature of the health problems. For instance, Native Americans were more likely to report suffering from depression, Black Americans reported higher rates of obesity, and when compared to White Americans, fewer Asians and Native Hawaiians reported having a personal healthcare provider.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>Racial health disparities exist in the United States and affect all ethnic groups at all different rates. However, can race be used to determine health outcomes? As our pool of knowledge concerning racial health statistics continues to expand, we can count on data to help determine one’s predisposition to certain diseases according to race and associated risk factors. One way we can close the gaps between desirable health outcomes and minorities is by making public health data more accessible. When data is accessible to the public, there is a greater chance that optimal personal health awareness can be achieved. Establishing fair and just public health legislation is another way to ensure that the health needs of all Americans are met. Public health is inherently political and requires the involvement of politicians to secure that the fundamental rights to health are protected. Furthermore, increasing affordable access to healthcare services, whether that is through telehealth services or government-led programs, will help decrease the racial health inequalities that exist as a result of financial strain and decades of systemic oppression.</p>
