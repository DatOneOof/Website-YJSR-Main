                        <p>Black holes are extraordinary objects - not even light can escape them. They are the remnants of a giant star that was unable to balance the gravitational inward pull, causing the star to collapse in on itself to a point called a singularity. It may seem impossible to imagine something that not even light can escape, but it has been done! A severe amount of time and effort went into the first image of a Black Hole.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Understanding black holes</h2>
                        <p>When the accreting object is a neutron star or a black hole, its proximity to the compact object causes the gas in the inner accretion disk to orbit at very high speeds. This results in friction heating the inner disk to temperatures at which vast amounts of EM radiation are emitted. This process is one of the most efficient energy-producing processes known as up to 40% of the rest of the accreted material can be emitted as radiation.</p>

                        <p>If our Sun unexpectedly were replaced by any black hole of equal mass, nothing much would happen to Earth’s orbit, although our planet would get rather frigid without the Sun’s light warming it. Actual black holes are much more enormous than our Sun. Black holes trap nearby gasses in their gravitational pull and whip them around in orbit at immense speeds. The gas material gets very hot and breaks apart into its constituent positive nuclei and negative electrons, not bound together as an atom. This hot mass of free electrons and nuclei is called plasma.</p>
                        
                        <p>The trapped plasma forms the accretion disk of a black hole – a disk of material gravitationally bound to the black hole. As charged particles go around, they accelerate, causing the emission of electromagnetic radiation. Some of this radiation, as well as radiation created by infalling material, is ejected in jets in directions related to the rotation of the black hole.</p>

                        <p>We usually see an object when radiation radiated or reflected by it enters our eyes. When we observe someone wearing a black T-shirt, we notice the light from the objects shrouding the black T-shirt and a reduction of visible light from the black T-shirt. Our eyes are great sensors for the small band of electromagnetic radiation known as the visible region of the spectrum. Scientists hoped to image the light around the frontier of the black hole and the absence of light within that boundary.</p>
                        
                        <p>Although an image of a black hole was not achievable before 2019, scientists predicted that the electromagnetic radiation from the accelerating plasma and the light of the photon sphere would be observable. The emitted jets of electromagnetic radiation have been observed. It was also predicted that there would be an absence of electromagnetic radiation at the event horizon where not even light can escape. Nevertheless, seeing is believing, and scientists began to work on it once it became clear that it was possible to picture the black hole.</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Could we image black holes?</h2>
                        <p>To image the black hole in the "Messier 87 galaxy", packets of light energy called photons had to travel for 6000 years through the "Messier 87 galaxy", then 55 million years to Earth, pass through Earth's atmosphere without interacting with anything but the detector being used to create the image. Some photons do not make this trip as quickly as others, and the primary difficulty is when the photons enter Earth's atmosphere. Visible light has a wavelength of about 0.5 millionths of a meter. Radio waves used to image the black hole was 1.3 millimeters. The resolving power of a telescope gets better for larger diameters and smaller wavelengths of light. Although visible light has a smaller wavelength, it interacts more with Earth's atmosphere. Radio waves travel much better through Earth's atmosphere, and by linking radio telescopes, e.g., in an array, the effective diameter can be enormous. It still gets dicey with radio waves because water molecules in the atmosphere can absorb them, so scientists try to put their detectors at high altitudes and in dry regions to collect these waves.</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Imaging</h2>
                        <p>The Event Horizon Telescope collaboration realized a way, developed years earlier, to get around one of their biggest initial problems. The problem: to image a black hole, the telescope had to be the size of Earth itself! It’s just not possible to create a single telescope that big. Some telescopes, such as those created with mirrors for visible light, have an upper limit on their structure – beyond a certain size the mirror would break under its own weight. Radio telescopes are different, they look like a mesh and are often configured in an array. And here comes some truly cool and clever science – but to understand it, it is best to go on an imaginary journey.</p>

                        <p class="img-cap">A parabolic reflector focuses light from afar, which enters with parallel rays, to a single point. Credit: Wikimedia commons</p>
                        
                        <p>Imagine you are looking into a big curved mirror, one that focuses light from far away at a single point, like in the diagram shown. This mirror would image a distant object at that focal point.</p>
                        
                        <p>Now imagine that there are dirt splotches covering up much of the mirror. You would be able to get a few rays from afar focusing at the focal point, but not enough to get a complete image or necessarily a clear image. If you were able to rotate the mirror (while it was still focused at the same object) you would gather more information about what the mirror is imaging because you would be able to gather light from different areas. But it would be important that the light you are gathering from the different clean parts of the mirror are coming from the same object and that they correlate with each other in time.</p>
                        
                        <p>To get a truly good resolution of the black hole in Messier 87, scientists needed a telescope the size of Earth. Now imagine that pieces of this imaginary Earth sized telescope could be like the clean spots on the mirror example above. The clean spots each have different telescopes on Earth. If these smaller telescopes are coordinated just right, they would be able to begin to create the image, but many measurements from different locations all around Earth would be needed.</p>

                        <p>This is just what the Event Horizon Collaboration did. They had 8 different telescopes all over the Globe (2 in Chile, 2 in Hawaii, 1 in Arizona, 1 in Spain, 1 in Mexico, and 1 in Antarctica) that would simultaneously work to image the black hole. To make sure the telescopes were correlated properly in time, each was fitted with an atomic clock so the data from each telescope could be properly combined. And the collaboration had an assist from Earth’s rotation. As Earth rotated, it allowed the individual telescopes (like the clean spots of the mirrors) to act as a different spot on the larger virtual Earth sized telescope, providing better resolution and imaging.</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Collaboration was the KEY</h2>
                        <p>The resulting image involved more than 200 researchers from over 100 institutions, who worked on how to coordinate 8 telescope stations located around the globe to work together. A great deal had to come together for this project to happen. Good weather was needed simultaneously at the different telescope locations, and by pure luck, they got it. Each of the telescopes needed to be synchronized, so they developed a way to retrofit each of the telescopes with their own atomic clocks. The data, about 350 trillion bytes per day, needed a way to be stored. They solved it. And then came the issue of processing the data –luckily two computing centers aided with this. Not only that – a great many people came together to sift through the data and support these efforts.</p>

                        <p>The brighter region on the bottom of the black hole is moving near light speeds toward us, and the dimmer region spins away from us, providing information that this black hole spins counterclockwise. This black hole is almost the size of our entire solar system and has a mass of 6.5 billion times our Sun’s.</p>
