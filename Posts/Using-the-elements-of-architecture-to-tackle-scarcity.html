                        <p>Scarcity, or in simpler words the limited amount of resources- while having a potentially unlimited demand. This phenomenon is prominent in everything relating to resources, covering most areas. When we talk about architecture, scarcity in it prioritises the material part- the resources needed to develop the space into structure. When the amount of materials has been compromised (or ideally even when not) , this style makes an effort to implement ‘sustainable architecture’ by taking the best advantage of the existing geographical and economic conditions of said area rather than introducing foreign concepts due to the scarcity of resources.</p>
                        <p>Such an ideology is not only used to make more suitable places now but for more availability of resources down the line- in a rapidly growing area. Thus, it is important for both the structure of a place and the designs which are added to complement the structure. Multiple existing spaces utilise resources in such ways, as it is an important part.</p>
                        <p>So here are two examples of the same.</p>
                        <p>In 1981, in the city Indore- India, IDA (Indore development authority) conducted a case study and discovered that approximately 51,000 families in Indore are either homeless or living in illegal housing. This  was the cause of starting the Aranya low-costing homes project, as the name suggests these groups of residences were built for the lower income families in Indore. The main driving idea for its growth was for the structures to be easily customizable- having the core necessities like accessible water so that it can later be developed as the residents please.Even today, the project functions as a community rather than a still structure to live in. While using the structure for this, Indore has fairly hot summers- with 36 degrees. The houses are built in proportion to the street's breadth, so that they are shaded from the sun at almost all times (unless there is direct sunlight). Moreover, Indore is covered with black cotton soil, which is good for growing cotton but considered problematic for construction. Thus, the houses are two storey; using shallow concrete. A shallow foundation is used when there are smaller structures, so there is no need for deep excavation or in relatively larger structures such as bridges. Different variations of this are used to assist with different variations of weak soil, such as a raft-like one made to cover the whole area of the site for an even base. Or strip footing,  a strip of foundation commonly for a load bearing part.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, while functionality is a huge part of architecture, another vital element is the design- the artistic side..To create aesthetically pleasing elements like beautiful cathedrals and extravagant facades we need an ample supply of materials. This statement is similar to a quote by Melanie Dodd (a professor of architecture), ‘when architectural needs are reduced to its absolute basic level the outcome challenges the conventionality of western architectural form’. Based onto this is the bold philosophy of Mexican Architect Luis Barragan; his style is one that amplifies the elemental parts of a structure. Light and Shadow, rough and smooth (textures),  or the utilisation of plants to make the place more lively.. Luis Barragan’s designs have much influence over the bold colours which paint the streets of Mexico.</p>
                        <p>These two elements of efficient construction and design together make up good and functional architecture. Moreover, in my opinion every building- or palace or bungalow or bridge should be made considering everything, and in a hypothetical situation that what if you are in a scarcity of materials.</p>
