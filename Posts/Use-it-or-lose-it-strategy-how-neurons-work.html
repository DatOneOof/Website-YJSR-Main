                        <p>The brain is the most complicated organ in our body system. It’s hard to resolve all its mysteries, yet it has many secrets we still don’t know. One of those mysteries is neurons.</p>
                        <p>Neurons are specialized cells designed to transmit electrical impulses in the brain. They have a variety of kinds. And unlike other cells, they have a unique structure. They contain a cell body, axon, and dendrites. At the end of axons, they include synaptic terminal buttons, which release chemicals called neurotransmitters that help to transfer impulses chemically to other neurons.</p>
                        <p>Neurons create a huge network to get information from everywhere. They rapidly create new connections with other cells. This helps them to receive and answer signals smoothly. However, they can only gain this ability if their connections are used sparingly.</p>
                        <p>Neurons follow a strategy called &OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;use it or lose it.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; According to this strategy, they can lose their large network if they are not used efficiently enough. We can make a simple analogy to describe this strategy. For instance, if we go to the gym often, we can make our muscles stronger and become healthier. This goes the same for neurons as well. They get stronger when used and become weaker when they are not.</p>
                        <p>This loss of connection of neurons is the reason for many neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's. Many studies conclude that Alzheimer patients’ brains get smaller and change shape during the illness. This is the result of connection loss of neurons. In other words, neurons &OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;lose&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; their ability to connect with other neurons.</p>
                        <p>But how this can be prevented from happening? Certainly, neurons don’t divide or reproduce. This means that new neurons can’t be created. But the brain can be strengthened with &OpenCurlyDoubleQuote; cognitive reserve.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; This hypothesis suggests a “high capacity” brain – one with there are a lot of healthy brain cells, and those brain cells have a lot of connections with one another. Creating a cognitive reserve can prevent diseases like Alzheimer's and help to gain new skills.</p>
                        <p>In this case, the new question is &OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;how can we create a cognitive reserve?&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote; <br>There are many ways to do so. Even the simplest activity can strengthen your brain and create a larger capacity. Some of them are mentioned below.</p>
                        <p><b>Reading:</b> Reading helps to see and learn new words, especially if it is done in several languages. Creating a broader vocabulary can increase neuron connections, which in return, it can help to strengthen the brain. Also, reading improves concentration and memory. For these reasons, even reading a few pages can be beneficial for the brain.</p>
                        <p><b>Sports:</b> It is long known that sports can help to increase an individual’s cognitive skills. Many studies show that people who are involved in sports are likely to increase their academics as well. Researches show that students who are involved in sports are likely to develop academic skills. Because sports help to improve focus and use other functions of the brain.</p>
                        <p><b>Learn new things:</b> It is proven that learning increases our brain functions. So that learning can change one’s brain physically and mentally. Learning new things every day can be great training for creating a cognitive reserve.</p>
                        <p><b>Doing something gin a different way:</b> Learning new skills and gaining new habits are great ways to work the brain; however, studies show that if activities are done in different ways, the brain can use multiple areas of the brain at the same time. For instance, if someone is right-handed, that person can increase his or her brain connections by trying to do some activities with his or her left hand.</p>
