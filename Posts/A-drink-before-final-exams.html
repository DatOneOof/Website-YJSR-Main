                        <p>During the exam season, there is far too much to learn and far too little time. Teachers assign mountains of revision work, parents put pressure on their children, and work hours have climbed into the double digits. People are rushing through the corridors, trampling over each other, their footfall uneven. If this describes your school, you should consider trying chrysanthemum tea.</p>
                        <p>Chrysanthemum tremendously helps your overall health. Chrysanthemum was initially cultivated in China in the 15th century. Believed to have powers of life, doctors employed the plant to remove pathogenic heat and enhance other physiological processes. Normally, information fades into history with the passage of time. However, chrysanthemum remains one of the most significant instruments in traditional Chinese medicine to this day.</p>
                        <p>In later years, scientists discovered chrysanthemums can be used to relieve stress. It’s important to reduce anxiety levels while studying. In 2019, students who scored 13-25 on the Liebowitz social anxiety scale were chosen to participate in a study. During the trials, participants were shown a face cue (happy or angry). They were later told that each face leads to a reward or punishment and that they had to “learn the optimal response” for each cue. After the trials were completed, the researchers found that the angry face cues evoked trait social anxiety in participants, which served both as a disruption in the learning process and as a deterrent to response time. In other words, stress slows down learning and concentration.</p>
                        <p>To measure the effect of chrysanthemum on stress, a group of Korean researchers put mice into a controlled experiment in 2012. In a controlled experiment, there are controlled variables. an experimental variable, a control group, and an experimental group. A control variable is a factor that remains the same throughout the experiment in both groups. Controlled variables are necessary because if they didn’t exist you wouldn’t know for sure that what is affecting the groups is the experimental variable and not a different factor. An experimental variable is the factor that you are testing in the experiment. This is the only difference in the setup of the control group and the experimental group. In the chrysanthemum study, the cage environment was the same in all groups: equal amounts of food and water, constant temperature, humidity, and lighting conditions. One group was given chrysanthemum distilled water solution and the other regular distilled water. Then, an elevated plus maze test was performed to find the anxiety levels of the mice. A standard plus maze contains two open arms that are 30x5 cm and two closed arms connected to a wall that is 30x5x5 cm which is joined to a central zone that is 5x5 cm to make a cross. Each mouse was individually placed in the central zone. If more time was spent in the open arms, the mouse’s anxiety levels were lower. If more time was in the closed arms, then the mouse’s anxiety levels were higher. The researchers found out that the control group, on average, spent less time in the open arms than the experimental, indicating that chrysanthemum reduces anxiety in mice. Mice are really similar to humans in terms of physiology and genetics. The mouse genome is “85 percent identical” to the human genome, meaning that we develop organs almost the same way. Considering this, we could infer that chrysanthemum reduces human anxiety levels as well.</p>
                        <p>Chrysanthemum tea can be bought from your local herb shop. If you don’t know any nearby, you can purchase it off Amazon for as little as $9.98. All you need to do to prepare the tea is put a few flowers at the bottom of your teapot (or cup) and pour hot water inside. Let it sit for a while before drinking. I recommend taking a few sips every fifteen minutes between studying. Good luck to everyone taking exams!</p>
