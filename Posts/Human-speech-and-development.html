                        <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>Within the first few years of life, humans develop from a newborn with limited capabilities to a toddler that is able to communicate and complete basic tasks. Results from a  study by the <i>American Psychological Association</i> suggest that prior to the “naming explosion”, occurring at eighteen months of age, children can learn a new object and quickly label it<sup>1</sup>. This demonstrates the rapid cognitive development infants undergo.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, research compiled over many decades has concluded babies have preferences for contrasting patterns, bright colors, movement, and human voices<sup>2</sup>. In the past fifty years, technological developments have made the simple, day-to-day aspects of parenting easier. For instance if a baby is upset, surrounding them with objects they enjoy - which often consist of bright colors and contrasting patterns - help soothe the child. Considering the exponential growth early in development, there are certainly ways to limit human cognitive development early. Along with the toddlers and infants, caregivers also watch TV because they are fascinated by the colors, voices, and movement. Despite the appeal in allowing children to watch TV, parents are advised to not permit their child to have any amount of screen time before attaining eighteen months of age<sup>3</sup>. While watching TV with the child may help to calm them down, it can have detrimental effects on their linguistic development.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">How Do Children Learn to Speak?</h2>
                        <p>Studies from The University of Washington suggest that infants are born with a preference for their maternal mother's language leading one to conclude language learning starts in utero<sup>4</sup>.  Newborns become accustomed to their mother tongue because they naturally prefer human voices as opposed to other sounds after birth; the stages preceding birth in regards to linguistics are no doubt influenced as a result. At three months of age, babies make cooing sounds, discern different people's voices, and also recognize certain voices over others<sup>5</sup>. By seven months, babies can pay close attention to music, make babble sounds (commonly referred to as ‘baby talk'), as well as respond to changes in tone of voice<sup>5</sup>. When a child is one year old, they normally imitate speech sounds and form simple words such as “mama” and “dada”. The rapid pace at which various speech forms progress to sound similar to the child’s language must be acknowledged when discussing how these stages are influenced and disrupted.</p>
                        <p>For people of all ages, the use of repetition is essential to master any given skill<sup>6</sup>. Notably for children, consistent repetition of language from a young age is critical to proper growth. Children increase their vocabulary by listening or holding conversations with other individuals and reading or listening to others read written material. Specifically, the common tradition of bedtime stories has positive effects on children, demonstrated by research led by a Stanford University psychology department member, Nereyda Hurtado. Hurtado concluded that children who experienced more “child-directed speech” were able to process familiar words at a faster rate and developed greater vocabulary at the twenty-four-month mark than those who had less exposure to such type of speech<sup>7</sup>.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Cognitive Development in Children in Relation to Screen Time</h2>
                        <p>Technology has undoubtedly influenced the process of finding valuable information to become more efficient, especially in the world of childcare. There are advantages and disadvantages for every decision an individual makes; consequently, allowing a baby to have screen time is not an exception, as studies have shown that an increase in screen time is correlated to delayed speech development<sup>8</sup>. This delay is not directly attributed to what the child watches, but rather due to the decreased time spent engaging in activities that screen time replaces. Although some programs and shows contain a multitude of interesting, educational facts that can be applied to the real world, television ultimately deviates individuals from engaging in productive activities such as reading and engaging in conversations. In order to prevent these detrimental effects, children under seventeen months of age should not watch any television, while children ages eighteen months to five years should be limited to one hour per day. The less engagement with the natural environment, the less children acquire important skills and knowledge, slowing their development progress. Delayed infant speech development can cause scholastic difficulties later in life, specifically in grade school years and career life. Thus, it is imperative that caretakers contribute to an environment in which the child can learn to their fullest potential<sup>9</sup>.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>Considered fully, it would be an inaccurate generalization to declare whether screen time is strictly either negative or positive. Understanding infant development is definitely beneficial, as one of the main responsibilities of caregivers is to support healthy psychological development. Although caregiving is by no means an easy task, it is important to take into account the effects small choices can have on a young child. In an interview with the <i>New York Times</i>, Dr. Hutton announced, “kids this age, they need human experiences for their brains to develop optimally and reinforce these tracts...We just really need to be careful about making sure kids have access to these same human interactive experiences that probably our brains are wired to require.” Encouraging parents to act in the best interest of their children is a step toward a healthier life for future generations.</p>
