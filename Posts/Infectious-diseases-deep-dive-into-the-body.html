                        <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>As humans, our bodies have about 37.2 trillion cells. Some of these cells' jobs are to break down food, supply nutrients/blood, or protect your body from disease. Our cells protect us from infectious illnesses every day! Believe it or not, we come into contact with harmful things every single day such as toxins, dirt, or bacteria. Our body protects us from these hazards by using protection strategies equipped such as coughing, sneezing, and rejection. Some of the illnesses we will be looking deeply at somehow affect cells, the tolls they take on the body, and ways we can prevent the spreading of these specimens. We will be diving into the microbiology behind Ebola virus Disease (Ebola), Influenza (Flu), Chikungunya virus Infection (Chikungunya virus), and Othrocoronavirinae (COVID-19, coronavirus).</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Body</h2>
                        <p>Coronavirus known as Covid-19 is an extremely deadly virus that latches its spiky surface protein to a receptor on healthy cells, especially those in your lungs. Viral proteins burst into cells through ACE2 to help the virus survive. Coronavirus hijacks healthy cells and takes command to survive. Some common symptoms for this virus are shortness of breathing or difficulty breathing, fevers, chills, sore throat, headaches, and muscle/body aches. Coronavirus can be contracted from airborne particles or from coming into contact with an infected individual. The mouth, nose, eyes, and throat are the main areas people contract the virus. Covid-19 is caused by SARA-CoV-2. SARS-CoV originated from bats and was transmitted to humans via civet cats.</p>

                        <p>The Ebola virus made news headlines in 2014 all the way through 2016. Due to the surge of this new disease that causes frightening symptoms such as severe gastrointestinal pain, violent vomiting, coughing up blood, internal bleeding, severe fever, and jaundice. The Ebola virus is a parasite that can be contracted through contact with a non-human primate (chimpanzee, bat, or monkey), people with Ebola virus symptoms, or recently deceased host through bodily fluids which include blood, vomit, diarrhea, urine, sweat, semen, or even breast milk. Contraction can even happen by contact with a deceased corpse without proper disposal of the corpse or any contact with a recently deceased corpse that had just passed away. The microbiology behind how Ebola affects human cells is quite complex. First, the cell develops a membrane through the plasma membrane of the host cell and forms a spiked appearance due to fusion proteins on their surface. These cells are sent to attack healthy immune cells and replicate in the cytoplasm of the cell they infected, leading to lower immune system defense and infected blood, organs and fluids.</p>

                        <p>Every year fall through winter, an infamous viral infection comes back in swing. Influenza or most known as the flu is a respiratory infection caused by viruses that are made to attack your respiratory system. The symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches, congestion, and fatigue. The contraction of this infection is very open, meaning it is very common to contract and easy to contract through touch, droplets, and fluids. This virus is spherical and binds to the host cell via hemagglutinin which is receptor binding glycoproteins. Hemagglutinin is found on the surface of the Influenza cell, it acts as a binding agent and also a protein for the cell to feed off of, making it responsible for binding Influenza cells to the salic acid on healthy cells such as erythrocytes and cells in your upper respiratory tract causing internalization of the virus. Hemagglutinin is also known for the ability to clump red blood cells together and potentially cause blood clots and many other complications.</p>
                        <img class="illus-img" src="../assets/others/infectious_diseases_mckenzie_shamari3.png">
                        <p>Chikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral infection. When the mosquito bites a host with the virus in their blood, the mosquito ingests the blood and ultimately contracts the virus. Once infectious, it is believed the mosquito has the virus for the rest of its life. The disease characteristics often get mixed up with the Dengue virus or most known as the Dengue fever because it is contracted very similarly and the symptoms are almost identical. These symptoms include fever, joint pain, headache, muscle pain, and fatigue. From the first encounter with a mosquito, the skin is infiltrated and the mosquito injects the virus into skin. The skin absorbs the virus into the fibroblasts (connective tissue cells) and into the bloodstream. The virus circulates through your bloodstream and attacks different groups of cells in the body, mostly the fibroblasts. Chikungunya also travels to the liver, spleen, brain, and lymph nodes causing many more complications.</p>
