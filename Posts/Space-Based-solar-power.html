                        <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>The Sun is known for providing energy and sustaining the lives of all species on Earth. This incredible resource emits energy and gives off both heat and light for us by fusing hydrogen into helium at its center. This is what we refer to as solar energy.</p>
                        <p>But there is a catch. <br>Only about half of this solar energy reaches the planet's surface. The atmosphere and clouds either refract or capture the remaining light.</p>
                        <p>What if we discovered a brand-new energy source that provided unlimited energy supply to every part of Earth? One that produces no carbon pollution, and is incredibly competitive with non-renewable energy? One that will coexist with solar and wind energy, preserve the Earth’s ecosystem, stop our reliance on foreign oil, and be able to transmit electricity straight to the world's most isolated and underdeveloped areas?</p>
                        <p>We might already have an answer: <i>Space-Based Solar Power</i>.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">What is Space-Based Solar Power?</h2>
                        <p>Space-based solar power (SBSP) is the process of harvesting the Sun’s energy in space and transmitting it to Earth for usage. To make this work, a constellation of solar panels must be launched into Earth's orbit to create a space power station that can capture solar energy. The technological process includes using solar panels with reflectors or inflatable mirrors on them to direct solar energy in the form of radiation onto the panels. The energy produced by these panels is then wirelessly transmitted to Earth via high-frequency radio waves, as well as beaming it via a microwave or laser. The Earth then receives the energy by a microwave antenna (a rectenna) and finally, it gets supplied through electric grid systems.</p>
                        <p>The idea of SBSP dates to 1923 when Russian scientist Konstantin Tsiolkovsky first suggested the objective of using space-based solar energy. Later, in 1941, American author Isaac Asimov developed this idea into a science fiction tale in which a satellite powered by solar energy beams energy down to Earth and even to other settlements in the solar system. In 1968, American aerospace expert Peter Glaser presented a possible outline that was not only "outside the box," but also completely outside Earth's atmosphere. Glaser suggested lofting solar panels into space on fleets of solar power satellites rather than constructing enormous solar fields across vast, environmentally susceptible expanses of land.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">The Pros of Space Based Space Power</h2>
                        <p>In SBSP, as you can already tell from the name, sunlight is available indefinitely outside the Earth’s atmosphere, day or night, rain or shine.</p>
                        <p>While orbiting the planet, a solar system in space could theoretically experience a 24-hour solar day, all 7 days of the week. As opposed to earth-based solar power systems, which only get sunlight during the day, this is a huge benefit. The weather and cloud cover on Earth do not affect the amount of sun energy that can be collected. Additionally, there is no possibility for animal or plant disruption.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, it makes use of less territory than conventional alternatives and helps supply energy to places that do not presently have stable power. This technology has the potential to power towns, workplaces, residences, and ultimately aircraft, thus providing a solution to the issue of future energy scarcity.</p>
                        <p>The major win of this concept is that it does not create toxic garbage, rely on freshwater resources, or release greenhouse gasses.</p>
                        <p>With an expected nearly 50% increase in global energy consumption by 2050, space-based solar power may be essential to addressing both the world's increasing energy needs and the issue of global warming.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">The Cons of Space-Based Solar Power</h2>
                        <p>There are still some problems with the idea of space-based solar electricity, despite the abundance of arguments in favor of it. How to construct, launch, and deploy such massive structures is one of the major obstacles to be surmounted. It may be necessary for a single solar power plant to cover an area of up to 10 kilometers squared, or 1,400 football fields. To get all the materials into orbit with these devices would cost a lot of money and take numerous space shuttle flights.</p>
                        <p>Also, safety risks include incorrect rocket launch procedures, long-term impacts of low-frequency electromagnetic radiation, and misdirection of the satellite's energy transfer beam, which could result in harm.</p>
                        <p>Space debris, space dust, asteroids, and intense solar radiation are just a few of the possible dangers that exist for solar cells in outer space. These could all seriously damage the system's stability. The energy could be dangerous to transfer back to Earth, and a significant quantity of energy would be lost in the process.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Is This the Right Time to Blink?</h2>
                        <p>As the climate catastrophe gets worse, space organizations around the globe have started studies looking at the viability of building actual orbiting power plants. Technology that could gather solar energy in space and transmit it to Earth to provide a worldwide supply of clean, green, and affordable energy to every nook and corner of the world was once thought to be science fiction, but it is now getting closer to becoming a reality. The stakeholders concur that such projects would be difficult to complete, but as the world's efforts to slow climate change continue to fall short, such moonshot endeavors may become essential.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Pilot Projects are Already Underway</h2>
                        <p>In Germany’s Airbus' X-Works Innovation Factory, a demonstration of solar power beaming from orbit was made on September 20, 2022. Even though it was a small-scale test, this technology appeared to have enough promise to be the future of clean energy. In this experiment, the wireless transmission device was able to disperse green energy at 118 feet. In addition to lighting up a model city, the energy stream was used to run a refrigerator and hydrogen generator.</p>
                        <p>In the US’s California Institute of Technology, scientists are working on the Space Solar Power Project to create high-efficiency solar cells and transfer and conversion systems that are best suited for use in space. Ali Hajimiri, one of the three Caltech professors overseeing the project, declared in a statement that "no matter what happens, this prototype is a major step forward." The aerospace firm Northrop Grumman and the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory have both contributed to the Space Solar Power Incremental Demonstrations and Research (SSPIDR) initiative of the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory. In 2020, SPPIDR carried out the first ground-based equipment test for the Arachne in-space flying trial. One of Arachne's tasks is to show the capacity to form and focus a radio-frequency beam in low-Earth orbit. It is anticipated to launch in 2025. According to the Air Force, the aim of the project is “to provide uninterrupted, assured, and logistically agile power to expeditionary forces.” Furthermore, the SPS-ALPHA Mark-II concept is being developed by the US using new technologies and has advanced economic feasibility of a SBSP project.</p>
                        <p>In the UK, according to the most recent Frazer-Nash Consultancy study, a £17 billion space-based solar power development is a viable idea. A functioning SBSP plant is anticipated to be active in 2040 after a series of short trials. The research is being directed by The Frazer-Nash Consultancy, and it will assess the top three SBSP concepts: the USA's SPS Alpha concept, the UK's CASSIOPeiA concept, and China's MR-SPS concept.</p>
                        <p>Since the 1980s, researchers in Japan have diligently studied SBSP. An idea for creating and trying innovative techniques for managing power beams and putting large structures together in orbit has been developed by researchers at the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA).</p>
                        <p>The European Space Agency (ESA) has sponsored numerous initiatives after realizing the promise of these efforts. The SOLARIS project, a suggested three-year research and development strategy to evaluate the viability of sizable solar farms in space, has also received approval from the ESA.</p>
                        <p>China, meanwhile, has reported advancements on its Bishan space solar energy plant, which aims to be operational by 2035. To showcase cutting-edge solar energy concentration and wireless power transfer technologies, the China Academy of Space Technology and Indian University in China built a sizable structure. The purpose of the new center was to test and validate the technology for the Orb-Shape Membrane Energy Gathering Array (OMEGA), a collector system for collecting solar energy in geostationary orbit.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>Centuries ago, who would have thought about beaming solar power from space being used up to run our planet? Sooner or later, this wild imagination will become our reality. The time bomb to save our planet is ticking. It’s high time we turned our backs to fossil fuels that are limited and will ultimately run out and begin considering feasible alternatives. SBSP may be the way to go. This will be a viable option and possibly a key weapon to fight against climate change in the future. But how close is the future?</p>
