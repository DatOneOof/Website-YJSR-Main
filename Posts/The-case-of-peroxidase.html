                        <p>Enzymes biological catalysts made out of amino acid proteins. The shape of their active site influences their catalytic effects. They lower the activation energy required to trigger a reaction, increasing speeds between 10^3 and 10^7 times faster. The enzyme-substrate “lock and key fit” bond is unique to the shape of a substrate and the enzyme’s active site that it binds with. The product molecule formed is the newly oriented substrate. This experiment aims to determine what milliliter concentration of extract and what temperatures will facilitate a greater light absorption of light in the spectrophotometer. This will test peroxidase efficiency. In this study, H<sup>2</sup>O<sup>2</sup> is the substrate and root extract are the enzyme/peroxidase-containing solution. When little to no enzyme is present, the chemical reaction takes significantly longer to occur than when enzyme is present to decrease activation energy needed for the reaction to occur. Based off the data at hand, a median temperature will promote peroxidase catalyzation efficiency, darkening brown substance color and increasing light absorption. The range indicated in the experiment is between 23 degrees and 32 degrees Celsius. To add, an increase in root extract will also cause peroxidase-substrate binding to increase, increasing brown substance color as well as light absorption. Thus, the 2.0 ml extract in tubes 6&7 decreased activation energy to decrease reaction time.</p>
                        <p>Null: There will be no significant variation that cannot be attributed to random chance between root extract percentage and temperature on light absorption, brown tint, and enzymic catalyzation activity.</p>

The spectrophotometer was zeroed out before putting the mixed contents in and light absorption was compared. As far as temperature, the contents in each tube had the same mixtures as packet tubes 1&2. The only variation was temperature. The mixed reaction was placed into a cup of hot water until the appropriate temperature (described above) was reached. Then it was immediately placed into the tube. Between uses, the test tubes were cleaned with cloth, so fingerprints could not hinder results.</p>

                            <li>The rate of the reaction is codependent of the enzyme concentration. With more enzyme’s and their active sites to bind with substrates for a “lock and key fit”, more reactions are sped up.

                            <li>Adding more substrate would increase efficiency up to a limit. While more substrates could bind to active sites, there would be a time where all enzymes are used at a given time, ensuring a “waiting time” for the remaining substrates prior to binding and facilitating reactions.</li>
                            <li>A change in temperature (especially the application of heat) would denature and enzyme’s quaternary shape, causing its active site to alter, so it would be unable to bind with substrates and facilitate reactions. This would increase reaction time and activation energy, decreasing efficiency. The same effect would occur with a drastic pH change- the enzyme would denature and become indefinitely unable to successfully catalyze reactions.</li>
                            <li>To determine the optimum temperature for peroxidase, both tube sets would have the same enzyme and substrate concentration, having a total volume of 8 ml. The temperature, approximately 5 degrees Celsius, 15 degrees Celsius, and 25 degrees Celsius would be the independent variable. A thermometer, ice cube, and hot water in pitcher would be used. The dependent variable is the light absorption. The temperature level that allows the greatest light absorption would be the best fit.<br><br>To determine the necessary pH level, the same test tubes and contents described above would be present; however, the root extract would change to independent variables avocado (basic), pineapple (highly acidic), and blueberry (mildly acidic). The varying pH levels, only difference between contents, would catalyze reactions at different rates. The spectrophotometer’s light absorption level would indicate enzyme presence (high absorption) or less presence (low absorption)- also known as the dependent variable.</li>
                            <li>To determine the actual concentration of enzyme in turnips using this lab process, it could be directly compared to results of known enzyme concentrations in roots. Namely, one could use the same measurements of each liquid, changing out the root extract. First, it could be substituted with papayas (high enzyme concentration) and then cooked papayas (lower enzyme concentration). Then, the light absorption (dependent variable) of these could be compared to turnips (root extract is the independent variable) to see which it is closer to. The higher the light absorption, the more enzyme present whereas the lower the light absorption, the less enzyme present.</li>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion/Sources of Error</h2>
                        <p>Three graphs are present. The first graph measures how an increase in pH will affect absorption, and the next two measure how temperature affects absorption. Enzymes minimize the activation energy (potential energy) needed to begin a reaction prior to the following use of kinetic energy. In their 3D quaternary shape, the enzyme has a “lock and key fit” with a specific substrate at its active site, acting as a unique amino-acid protein catalyst that speeds up a reaction to increase efficiency. This enzyme-substrate complex undergoes an “induced fit”, where the binding tightens and then products are synthesized as enzyme (and thus substrate) slightly changes shape prior to the release of products. In this experiment, the absorption of light was measured using a spectrophotometer to study how the efficiency of peroxidase is dependent on the variables at hand. When more light is absorbed, that indicates more hydrogen peroxide degraded, producing an increase in oxygen to oxidize guaiacol, resulting in a darker brown medium. First, the null states that there will be no significant variation between light absorption in each tube set. With 2 degrees of freedom (3-1=2), and a chi square value of 0.027, the null is rejected. A chi square value of 0.027 is quite small; however, a significant amount of the measured data falls below one and the precision of data values is so exact, it was importance to have a critical value with 99% accuracy as opposed to 95%. With a critical value of 0.020 at 99% accuracy to recognize the precision of such miniature values to begin with, it is evident the null is rejected because 0.027>0.020. To further analyze the validity of this statement, it is necessary to deduce the 7% difference of absorption between tubes 2&3 and 4&5, a 12% difference between tubes 4&5 and 6&7, and a 6% difference between tubes 1&2 and 6&7 (Figure 1). The experiment measured how an increase in ml extract (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0) will influence results. When tubes 2&3 were combined with 0.5ml of extract present, the absorption level was 0.945 (Figure 1). An increase is displayed in tubes 4&5 with 1.0 ml of extract because the absorption result was 1.010. Lastly, a 0.115 decrease in light absorption occurred when tubes 6&7, containing 2.0 ml of extract combined, resulting in a value of 0.895 (Figure 1). This means that mL level extremes do not increase efficiency, but a median is preferred to produce the best results, so 1.0 mL of extract will increase absorption and thus the enzyme-substrate binding at its active site can catalyze said reactions. Tubes 4&5 also had the greatest rate, 0.0042, which details a higher light absorption, indicating that its quicker (likely due to higher concentration) at binding with substrates and catalyzing reactions (Figure 1). <i>While Figure 1 implies that a median enzyme concentration is best, a greater enzyme concentration is preferred, but eventually it reaches a limit; however, once the limit is reached, productivity remains- it does not necessarily decrease. Instead of 1.0 ml extract absorbing the most light, 2.0 ml of extract should absorb the most light or a nearly equal amount- not less. This likely occurred because the substances were put into the spectrophotometer at slightly different times, they did not completely mix, or the spectrophotometer was not “zeroed-out” correctly.  The machine was also shared with another group, so the substances that were separated into tubes might have changes temperatures at different paces while waiting to be combined and placed into the machine. Tubes 6&7 also produced the darkest brown substance, displaying that more hydrogen peroxide degraded, resulting in more oxygen to oxide more guaiacol. This contradicts the graph but proves the correct point.</i> In their 3D quaternary structure, protein enzymes can only hold their shape, the specific shape that permits the lock and key fit with a substrate, at certain temperatures. The goal of this portion of the study was to determine what the necessary temperature range would be to increase enzyme efficiency, and which temperatures would cause the enzyme to denature- or break apart (unable to catalyze reactions). With a chi square value of 1.218 and two degrees of freedom (3-1=2), the null, temperature variation will have no significant effect of results, is rejected. This is because the critical value is 0.020 (as described above, this value is so specific to account for 99% of data due to the extremely miniature/precise values at hand), and 1.218>0.020. Test tubes 2&3, placed in 25 degrees Celsius, reached a limit at 140 seconds, incapable to absorbing any more light; however, tubes 4&5 reached this with 30 degrees Celsius at the beginning as well as tubes 6&7 at 35 degrees Celsius (Figure 2). This indicates that the enzymes denatured at 30 and 45 degrees Celsius, unable to catalyze reactions and decrease activation energy. That is why the light absorption values, 0.584 and 0.580 decrease as temperature increases (especially when compared to 1.962) because the enzymes lost their shape, and the substrate could not bind at the active site. This means that an increase of energy will restrict catalyzation success. Similar to graph one, the highest light absorption tubes in Figure 2 also had the highest rate of absorption. This implies a direct connection between variables. Namely, tubes 2&3 had the highest absorption rate of 0.0082 when comparing temperature variations, and they also had the highest total absorption (Figures 1 and 2). This means the enzymes (likely high in concentration) could bind to more substrates at a time, catalyzing at a greater rate. <i>A median temperature range is preferred to facilitate enzyme-substrate efficiency. However, Graph 2 shows that while this is true, a moderate amount of light was still absorbed, so the enzymes were able to catalyze some reaction when heated. This would indicate they did not denature but facilitated reactions occurred. The third graph details what should have happened- by 80-100 degrees Celsius, close to 0.0 of light should have been absorbed in the small timeframe. The optimal range is instead would have been between 23-32 degrees Celsius at approximately 0.60-0.65. While the data at hand accurately implies that variation in enzyme activity is due to the independent temperature variable and cannot be attributed to random chance, the first line graph fails to display that. These errors also could be due to a variety of reasons, temperature may have not been consistent throughout the substance when measured, but the chemical solutions have been combined and then placed into the spectrophotometer at different times, attributing different light absorptions to inaccurate timeframes. Also, at this point in the process, the enzymes may have denatured or completely catalyzed prior to day 2 of the experiment- when tubes 4&5 as well as tubes 6&7 were measured with their respective temperatures. Graph 3 demonstrates what would have resulted (described above) had all operations been successfully undergone. It details a preferred temperature range, between 23 and 32 degrees Celsius, showing a decrease in catalyzation across the extremes.</i></p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Recommendations</h2>
                        <p>My group chose to take images of our test tubes to compare colors and determine connection to light absorption. This helped us verify the validity of our claim and conclusion, so I would strongly suggest future groups do the same. To add, I would suggest that people work in groups of 4-5 students. This would give each group their own spectrophotometer, so the lab could be completed in one class, and enzymes won’t denature overnight. There are a multitude of steps in this lab, so everyone would still have a significant job. Since this is an independent lab, students would still have the same amount of work to do in terms of a formal CER. Lastly, I would suggest that students compare their data to other graphs. This would allow them to analyze their data, but due to the high level of inaccuracies and ways this lab could go wrong, they would know what should occur to describe that as well. I did this (graph #3), and this significantly increased by understanding.</p>
