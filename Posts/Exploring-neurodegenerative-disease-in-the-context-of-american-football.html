                        <p>Our nervous system is responsible for many essential functions vital to sustaining human life. The most significant organ of that system is the brain. An average brain doesn’t fully develop until about age 25. This leaves certain parts of the brain susceptible to injury, which is detrimental regardless of how lasting its physiological effects are, as those brain regions are still in their infancy. Naturally, high-contact sports, most notably football, may increase an adolescent’s risk of developing neurodegenerative disease. The average teenager's brain relies on the amygdala (which is associated with impetuousness and aggression), because the prefrontal cortex (which is associated with cognitive control and impulse control) is still developing up until the mid-20s. Imagine how harmful a hit to the head is for a teenager whose brain still hasn’t fully developed and already relies on an emotion-driven part of the brain. Though football has been embedded in American culture, there must be a minimum age set to play because the neurological pathology associated with this sport outweighs the benefits of playing. More specifically, participation in the sport at a young age can lead to an increased risk of developing fatal diseases such as Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), among other neurodegenerative diseases later on in life.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Exploring Neurodegenerative Disease in the Context of a High-Contact Sport</h2>
                        <p>To understand how detrimental these neurodegenerative diseases are, let’s explore the nature of the disease from the lens of neuropathologists or medical specialists in brain disease.  A study titled “Post-Traumatic Neurodegeneration and Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy,” written by Daniel Daneshvar et al. demonstrates how current data suggests that traumatic brain injury and repetitive hits to the head may lead to “long-term debilitating effects, and in some cases, progressive neurodegeneration and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).” Chronic traumatic encephalopathy is characterized by many pathologists as an excessive buildup of tau protein in the brain caused by repeated hits to the head and concussion episodes. Daneshvar’s research of cognitive deficits and mood disturbances found that professional football players who were retired and sustained “3 or more concussions” reported more cognitive symptoms, which included a “threefold increase in diagnosed mild cognitive impairment compared to retired players without a history of concussion.” This displays how frequent cases of neurodegenerative diseases are in patients with a history of concussions. Researchers also discovered a significant delay in cognitive function for those who suffered from numerous concussions in their clinical neurological examinations in a sample of retired NFL athletes. These mental deficiencies were also associated with white matter pathology and regional cerebral blood flow abnormalities. This is detrimental because white matter diseases and cerebral blood flow complications are linked to stroke and dementia. The brain is a magnificent organ capable of countless wonders, from producing ideas and allowing us to experience the world around us to rewiring itself via neuroplasticity. However, when damaged, this singular organ can lead to the downfall of other organ systems and, by extension, end human life.</p>
                        <p>Another study, titled “Impact of Playing American Professional Football on Long-Term Brain Function,” written by D. G. Amen et al., investigates the observed pattern regarding American football participation on the brain’s capacity to function long-term. Their study involved a sample of 100 active and retired NFL players that represented all teams and positions, three computerized neuropsychological assessments, and brain scans. From the data they collected, the researchers of the study concluded that there were statistically significant “global decreases across the whole brain (in terms of blood flow to the brain), especially in the prefrontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes, anterior and posterior cingulate gyrus, and cerebellum.” These regions of the brain are associated with fine and gross motor skills, behavior, and critical thinking. Collectively in both their qEEG (which measures the electrical activity of the brain) and SPECT scan (which measures blood flow to the brain via arteries and veins), researchers found “significantly elevated slow waves in the bilateral temporal regions and bilateral frontal lobes.” These slow waves indicate focal cerebral pathology in the underlying brain region with consistent slow-wave activity suggesting a more severe underlying cerebral dysfunction. As the data suggests, there is a huge risk associated with playing football, among other high-contact sports. Now imagine how this risk is heightened for those with underdeveloped brain regions. The study was conducted on the brains of current and retired NFL players and covered all game positions. So it’s reasonable to conclude that with regions of the brain still in their infancy for teenagers, numerous concussive and subconcussive hits to the head may lead to even greater fatalities among the age group due to the brain’s vulnerability.</p>
                        <p>Another study titled “High School Football and Risk of Neurodegeneration: A Community-Based Study,” written by Rodolfo Savica et al. discusses the evolution of medical literature and how studies suggest that higher risk for progressive neurodegenerative diseases have become linked to American football, soccer, and hockey as they “predispose players to head trauma.” The study identified 13 cases of dementia among the football player sample (438) and two cases of dementia among the non-football players (140). Although there had been more cases identified in the football player sample, we must recall that the sample size for the football players was larger. Therefore, the differences between their observed and expected data were also not statistically significant. However, within the study, researchers were still concerned that repetitive head trauma associated with high school football might have “predisposed” players to a higher risk of neurodegenerative pathology such as CTE. In addition, their sample size was “relatively small” by their own account. Thus, the study is susceptible to a type two error, which means failing to reject a null hypothesis that is actually false. So although the study didn’t find an increased risk of neurodegenerative disease in those that participated in high school football, their experimental methods were executed in a manner that left the study vulnerable to countless biases.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>We need to strive to do what’s best for today’s youth as a society. Whether it’s influencing local legislation on safety precautions involving participation in high school football and other high contact sports or educating school districts about what the medical literature suggests and ways we can prevent a new generation of athletes from suffering the same fate as previous ones. Ultimately, it is up to us to put an end to this seemingly inconsequential activity, cease the exploitation of young athletes on the basis of athletic fulfillment, and educate the new generation of young men and women who wish to engage in this perilous sport.</p>
