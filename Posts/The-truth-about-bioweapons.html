                        <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>Beginning in the year 1155 when Emperor Barbarossa I of the Roman Empire poisoned water wells with human bodies, most of which had died from the plague, bioweapons have been long used as a method of warfare <sup>[3]</sup>. Yet despite the horrors and deaths, the circumstances have continued to be hidden by the onset of disease.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Modern Use</h2>
                        <p>Today, bioweapons are often hidden by the major use of hand-held violence. However, the major world wars have marked a significant turnover, as did conflicts over war and territory in the pre-modern age. In 1495, the Spanish mixed wine with the blood of leprosy patients to sell to the French; in 1650, the Polish fired saliva from rabid dogs at enemies <sup>[3]</sup>. The constant use of violence spread to the United States against Native Americans, and even years later, the World War made everyone assume “the worst” of each country. Japan, Russia, and the United States all began further research, Japan being the first to use their weapons, yet with the Cold War that would come, the latter two began an independent race <sup>[8]</sup>.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Consequences</h2>
                        <p>The circumstances of bioweaponry are odd as they are both beneficial and have a potential for loss- an odd combination. Albeit bioweapons are commonly associated with negative impacts, they have the potential to be used to kill harmful bacteria in mass amounts without major impacts on the human population. Competitive to chemical weapons, biological weapons can reproduce by themselves, are effective in low doses, and can be directed toward specific targets, or in this case, bacteria <sup>[4]</sup>.</p>
                        <p>With all biotechnology, bioweapons can be misused through mishandling or incorrect processes. One major cause of misuse is the incubation period, described as the time between initial infection and showing of symptoms, taking anywhere from a few hours to several days. Since the action is not instantaneous, bioweapons have been overused, meaning that more than necessary has been used by those attempting to eradicate a given population. Another possible misuse of bioweapons is by contaminated water. Although contaminated water has previously been a method to eliminate populations, it can often lead to contamination of other sources. The same goes for resources being sold, as they can be sold or spread to the wrong people or areas. More recently in 1984, Rajneeshee cult members, members of a movement centered around an Indian mystic, attempted to influence elections in Oregon, USA by contaminating salad bars with <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i>. This attack gave control over the weapons to a specific group of people, those who wished to elect members of their own group, showing ill-treatment of the technology. In addition, this misuse caused seven hundred and fifty-one people to contract salmonellosis, with forty-five needing hospital care <sup>[7]</sup>.</p>
                        <p>Another misuse of bioweapons was with anthrax in 2001. In October 2001, “anthrax spore[s] containing letters were sent to Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota and Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont” <sup>[5]</sup>. This action, better described as a failed assassination event, used weaponized anthrax to create a weaponizing cloud of the powdered disease. This led to the death of five individuals and seventeen were infected by inhalation anthrax, which showed that in the wrong hands, bioweapons have the potential of bioterrorism <sup>[5]</sup>.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Developments</h2>
                        <p>Throughout history, although there have been many breakthroughs, one of the most significant was the creation of the “ebolapox”, a type of superbug. Originally experimented on by the USSR, the idea was to “splice together segments” of the Ebola and variola (smallpox) virus, creating a virus deadlier than both Ebola and variola. This super virus, also known as a “superbug”, was shown to transmit through the air and added genes from Ebola into the smallpox genome. Additionally, the superbug is predicted to have a 100% mortality rate through research and experimentation with microorganisms, and as files are now marked confidential, the true research and development of the bug continues to remain unknown <sup>[9]</sup>.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">The Final Picture</h2>
                        <p>The studies on bioweapons continue to grow every day, as they aim to bridge two pillars of history, biology and warfare. In recent research, it has been understood that if used correctly, bioweapons may be able to eradicate some populations of bacteria through synthesizing micro-organisms with known sequences. However, history has proved a cycle of repetition and abuse, both in war and in discrimination. Therefore, bioweapons have the potential to be useful if eradicating some bacterial populations; nonetheless, they are mostly used for defense, and war, quite literally being a weapon of <b>mass destruction</b>.</p>
