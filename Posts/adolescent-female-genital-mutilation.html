                        <p>Adolescent female genital mutilation has caused numerous negative health and psychological ramifications, causing a need for intervention measures.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Abstract</h2>
                        <p>Female genital mutilation (FGM) is an invasive operation that intersects with the vulnerability of youth and entangles their futures with health ramifications that grow with time. This subject is an urgent issue in public health, especially for youth. In the modern age of fostering social equality, forging a path towards healthier lives for young girls should be seen as a priority. Through meticulous analysis, this paper aims to illuminate the multifaceted aspects of FGM's impact on health and well-being. By scrutinizing the physical and psychological aspects of FGM, we can pinpoint societal outlooks on the issue as well as intervention measures. These potential intervention strategies can not only mitigate the health risks but also bring attention to this practice, balancing culturally sensitive approaches.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>The punishment is harsh and brutal. The “crime”? Being born a girl. Adolescent female genital mutilation (FGM) is a critical issue affecting modern youth health. According to UNICEF, an estimated 200 million people worldwide, most of them being under 15, have undergone some form of female genital mutilation (FGM) (<i>What Is Female Genital Mutilation?</i>, 2023). Yet, not much about this practice is heard about it in first-world countries. FGM is a deeply rooted ritual that involves the partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, and it stands as a stark manifestation of the complex interplay between cultural norms, gender dynamics, and health risks. Since FGM is usually conducted in unsanitary conditions, it can lead to serious health complications, including infection, pain, difficulties in urination, childbirth complications, psychological trauma, and even death. It is widely condemned by international human rights organizations and medical professionals due to its harmful and potentially life-threatening consequences. However, due to its cyclic nature, it's a challenge to get change to happen in these societies. By delving into the background of this issue, the health implications of this practice on youth, and its social impacts, this paper seeks to highlight the urgent need for comprehensive understanding and intervention.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Disclaimer</h2>
                        <p><i>This paper acknowledges that women are not the only ones who are affected by FGM, but transgender people too. In this paper, we try to refer to those who are affected by FGM as those with female genitalia, and other broader terms. </i></p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Background</h2>
                        <p>Female genital mutilation, also called female genital cutting, is not a product of the 21st century. In fact, it has deep historical roots in various cultures, religions, and social practices around the world. Some scholars have theorized Ancient Egypt to have originated FGM, due to evidence from circumcised mummies from fifth century BC. An opposing theory suggests the practice spread across the routes of the slave trade, from the Red Sea to the African regions, or spread from the Middle East to Africa via Arab traders (Llamas, 2017). Regardless of its origin, FGM as a practice has become somewhat common in parts of Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and even among diaspora communities worldwide. </p>
                        <img class="illus-img" src="../assets/others/adolescent_female_genital_mutilation_patricia (2).png">
                        <p class="img-cap"><b>Figure 1:</b> Geographic Distribution of FGM (Llamas, 2017)</p>
                        <p>Figure 1 (above) displays the percentage of girls aged 0 to 11 years who have undergone FGM, based on information from UNICEF global databases. However, it's important to note that the figure displays statistics from 2017, and it has been suggested that these numbers have decreased since then. Today, youth are about one-third less likely to be subjected to FGM than 30 years ago. Yet, global prevalence remains high, as FGM is not entirely eliminated as a practice around the world (<i>What Is Female Genital Mutilation?</i>, 2023). </p>
                        <p>The diversification of FGM in its location is also reflected in how it is practiced. FGM has many different forms ranging from clitoridectomy to infibulation. Though FGM has been associated with the idea of circumcision, many have suggested the proper word to be “eradication.” As said by Carla Makhlouf Obermeyer, a prominent research figure from Harvard, there’s no completely satisfactory term to call the practice, as the term “female genital mutilation” itself is met with controversy; many say it is too harsh or brutal a name. Despite the controversy around its name, there is no denying the fact that FGM presents itself in many forms and types.</p>
                        <p>As mentioned before, the different types of FGM are closely linked to local cultures, religions, and beliefs. The proposed purposes of FGM include many presuppositions and beliefs, such as emphasizing the theories of virginity and purity. These are linked to societal pressures and impacts of FGM, to be touched upon in a later section.</p>
                        <p>However, it’s simple to sort out the different physical types of FGM. Nahid Toubia from Columbia University created a new type of classification that groups the most common forms of female circumcision into two categories: clitoridectomies (type I and II procedures) and infibulations (type III and IV procedures) (Toubia, 1994). </p>
                        <p>Type I clitoridectomy is defined as the removal of a part of the clitoris or the whole organ. Another more common name for this operation is “Sunna circumcision” (Toubia, 1994). Type II clitoridectomy, also called excision, involves excision (cutting out) of the clitoris and part of the labia minora. These types of operations can cause bleeding but can be halted with catgut or thorn or the application of any other homemade poultices. After healing, the clitoris is absent, but there is still a presence of the urethra and the vaginal introitus (Toubia, 1994).</p>
                        <p>Type III FGM is called modified/intermediate infibulation. This is a milder form of infibulation, which involves the same amount of cutting, but in which only the anterior two-thirds of the labia majora are stitched. This leaves a larger posterior opening, thus being a bit less invasive (Toubia, 1994). Type IV, or total infibulation, is regarded as the most invasive type of FGM. Total infibulation involves the removal of the clitoris and the labia minora, and an incision of the labia majora is also preformed to create raw surfaces that are stitched together. The purpose of this is to cover the urethra and the entrance to the vagina, thereby leaving a very small posterior opening for the passage of urine and menstrual blood (Toubia, 1994). All of these different types of FGM come into play when we talk about health complications, as the severity of health ramifications varies wildly depending on how severe the operation was. </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Health Ramifications</h2>
                        <p>WHO, in a paper about FGM, stated that there are “no health benefits, only harm” when it comes to the operation. It has been globally agreed that female genital mutilation interferes with the natural functions of bodies and is an incredibly invasive procedure. Although all forms of FGM are associated with an increased risk of health complications, the risk is greater with more severe forms of FGM. For example, risks associated with type III would vary greatly from type IV. Additionally, FGM is most common in youth, causing youth to be the most at risk. This concern is global, as more than 3 million people are estimated to be at risk of FGM annually (<i>Female Genital Mutilation</i>, 2023). </p>
                        <p>From the perspective of public health, FGM is much more damaging than male circumcision. The mildest form, clitoridectomy or type I (explained in the background section of this paper), is anatomically equivalent to complete amputation of the penis (Toubia, 1994). Additionally, the conditions in which FGM is conducted are typically unsanitary with little to no clinical supervision, causing an even greater risk of added complications such as infection (Ghosh et al., 2023). In a 2023 research paper, it was estimated that a 50% increase in the number of girls subject to FGM results in 44,320 excess deaths per year across countries where FGM is practiced. According to these figures, this would mean that FGM is a leading cause of the death of girls and young women in those countries, more than enteric infections, respiratory infections, or malaria (Ghosh et al., 2023). </p>
                        <p>Aside from the excess deaths caused by FGM, there are also several physical complications due to FGM. UNICEF cites some immediate concerns as hemorrhage, shock, infection, HIV transmission, urine retention, and severe pain (<i>What Is Female Genital Mutilation</i>?, 2023). Alongside this, long-term effects of FGM can vary from urinary problems, vaginal problems such as painful menstruations, increased risk of childbirth complications, need for later surgery, and of course, psychological trauma (<i>Female Genital Mutilation</i>, 2023). Figure 2 (below) displays some of the major complications of FGM, based on studies conducted with patients who have experienced FGM. </p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Social Impact</h2>
                        <p>To understand the social impact of FGM, we must understand the supposed purposes of FGM in a societal context. Commonly mentioned reasons for practicing are linked to various forms of control of female sexuality—such as to prevent debauchery and promiscuity, and to ensure virginity before marriage and marital fidelity (Llamas, 2017). Other reasons include using FGM to mark coming of age and status change within the community, and for religious reasons due to the belief that the practice is a religious recommendation. Yet, it should be noted that FGM is not formally prescribed by any religion (O’Neill & Pallitto, 2021). The two social impacts in this category are (1) the social impact on the person who underwent FGM, such as psychological impact, and (2) the social impact on society, such as how FGM affected society and vice versa. The impact of FGM also varies greatly with how important FGM is viewed in a particular society. </p>
                        <img class="illus-img" src="../assets/others/adolescent_female_genital_mutilation_patricia (1).png">
                        <p class="img-cap"><b>Figure 3: </b> FGM status can affect women differently in high prevalence versus diaspora settings (O’Neill & Pallitto, 2021).</p>
                        <p>To start the discussion on the first type of social impact, impact on the person, consider Figure 3. The diagram shows how the way FGM is viewed in different societies can contribute to its direct impact on those who have undergone the operation. Researcher Nahid Toubia in their article for The New England Journal of Medicine reflects on their personal clinical experience in Sudan, stating how many infibulated women have a syndrome of “chronic anxiety and depression arising from worry over the state of their genitals, intractable dysmenorrhea, and the fear of infertility” (Toubia, 1994). </p>
                        <p>In a study among women who were seeking clitoral reconstructive surgery in Sweden, Jordal et al. (2018) explored women’s conceptions of how FGM affected their sex life and intimate relationships. They perceived their inability to enjoy sex as a handicap. This lead to a general sense of inadequacy among the informants who perceived their genitalia as ugly and dysfunctional, which caused a feeling of shame as well as negative self-esteem (O’Neill & Pallitto, 2021). </p>
                        <p>Along with self-esteem issues, long-term mental health complications include an increased risk of depression and anxiety, reduced social functioning, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (<i>Mental Health and…</i>, n.d.). According to The International Centre for Research on Women, flashbacks, sleep difficulties, nightmares, memory problems, obsessive–compulsive tendencies, irritability and frustration, phobia, paranoid thoughts, emotional numbness, somatic disorders, and dissociation are amongst other mental health issues that can arise from FGM. Thus, the effects of FGM are not limited to health concerns, and can invisibly impact these youth for the rest of their lives. </p>
                        <p>In terms of the broader societal context, FGM underscores gender inequality, reflecting unequal power dynamics between men and women in societies where the practice is prevalent. For example, a 57-year-old man in Benin in a report from the Government of Canada stated, “patriarchy has imposed this situation which ended up becoming a tradition. It’s men’s power that caused this situation.” The results of the report showed there are various socio-cultural, economic, and religious factors motivating or deterring the practice of FGM. For example, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, an incredibly common source country for study participants, FGM is used as a “weapon of war” (Research in Brief - Female Genital Mutilation 2022). Other motivating factors include those discussed earlier, such as the concept of virginity and purity. </p>
                        <p>Furthermore, FGM can persist and perpetuate from one generation to the next, sustaining harmful cultural norms and inflicting lasting physical and psychological effects on successive youth. Adolescents are particularly vulnerable to the adverse health effects of FGM, as they face lifelong consequences that impact their physical and mental well-being. To stop this cyclic tradition, actions must be taken against FGM. The practice is typically illegal in the countries that practice it, and it has been also declared a human rights violation by international organization such as WHO (<i>Female Genital Mutilation</i>, 2023). It reflects deep-rooted inequality and constitutes an extreme form of discrimination. Additionally, the practice is almost always carried out on minors by traditional practitioners; a violation of the rights of children. The practice also violates a person's rights to “health, security, and physical integrity; the right to be free from torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment; and the right to life, in instances when the procedure results in death” (<i>Female Genital Mutilation</i>, 2023). </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Intervention</h2>
                        <p>Opposition to FGM is quickly growing, with the majority of girls and women (roughly 7 in 10) in most countries in Africa and the Middle East with representative data believing the practice should be eliminated. This proportion is about twice what it was only two decades ago (<i>What Is Female Genital Mutilation?</i>, 2023). This section of the paper looks at this issue of youth health and uses the concerns around FGM to ask questions about the future, as well as lists recommendations for eliminating the practice.</p>
                        <p>Current efforts are being made to stop FGM. The UNFPA-UNICEF program has helped more than 6 million girls and women receive prevention, protection, and treatment services related to FGM. Some 45 million people in communities across 15 countries have now made public declarations to abandon the practice (<i>What Is Female Genital Mutilation?</i>, 2023). For meaningful change, it's also essential to provide education on this issue. This education goes beyond surface-level understanding, covering the health dangers, legal consequences, and human rights violations linked to FGM. This also extends to future research, with a potential avenue for research suggested to be how “excess mortality varies within countries between areas in which FGM is differentially prevalent” (Ghosh et al., 2023). </p>
                        <p>Engaging community leaders, elders, and influencers emerges as a critical strategy in the campaign to eliminate Female Genital Mutilation (FGM). The involvement of these influential figures serves to validate and endorse intervention efforts, while also serving as conduits for fostering awareness, comprehension, and open dialogues concerning the imperative abandonment of this deeply ingrained practice. Collaborating with individuals who wield considerable authority within their communities holds the potential to penetrate entrenched cultural norms, thereby catalyzing collective action toward the eradication of FGM.</p>
                        <p>Another powerful tool to stop the cycle of FGM would be to focus on the empowerment of young girls through education. By nurturing an emerging generation of enlightened advocates, intervention programs address FGM at its roots, leveraging the potential of these individuals to reshape cultural norms and practices in the long term. This allows for these youth themselves to acknowledge exactly what challenges are facing their society, and what to do about them. Educating youth fosters positive change and encourages them to challenge the status quo. The goal of intervention is to facilitate a reconciliation between deeply entrenched traditions and the fundamental principles of health and human rights. We must work to acknowledge the resilience and significance of tradition while simultaneously championing a trajectory towards a safer, healthier future for all.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>The issue of adolescent female genital mutilation (FGM) emerges as a critical concern that demands immediate attention and intervention. Throughout this paper, it was shown how FGM can drastically hurt youth both physically and mentally. These impacts encompass the physical, psychological, and socio-cultural dimensions. From infections and death to PTSD, the colossal issue of FGM cannot be understated</p>
                        <p>Different forms of FGM are linked to local traditions and beliefs, with reasons ranging from the enforcement of gender roles to religious interpretations. However, regardless of its origins, the harmful and invasive nature of FGM remains consistent, posing grave health risks to those subjected to it. FGM is also shown to reflect and perpetuate gender inequality and power dynamics within societies. Societies that practice FGM are challenged to reconcile deeply entrenched traditions with the principles of health and human rights, highlighting the need for culturally sensitive interventions that promote awareness, education, and dialogue. Suggested intervention measures to combat FGM highlight the importance of education and empowerment. The collective efforts of individuals, communities, and organizations are pivotal in breaking the cycle of tradition and fostering a future that prioritizes the health, well-being, and rights of all. The punishment will not exist, and the “crime” will not be a crime anymore.</p>
