                        <h2 class="section-heading" id="cont-1">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>Based on comprehensive evidence, the active galactic nuclei (AGN) are supermassive black holes at the center of a galaxy that emit an immense amount of energy in the form of optical, gamma, radio, and x-ray radiations or fast-moving particle jets along with the enormous amount of luminosity.</p>
                        <p>Complicated, right? Let's break it down and understand it.</p>
                        <p>A black hole has gas and other matter accreting into it; it's called an active Black Hole because it actively grows its mass. Such Black holes usually sit in the nucleus of supermassive galaxies of galactic matter. Now, please focus on the words active, galactic and nucleus and put them together. It simply means an active supermassive black hole sitting in the center of a supermassive galaxy having very high luminosity in different forms.</p>
                        <p>Much of the Energy creation of AGNs is of a non-thermal class of emission, with many AGNs being powerful emitters of x-ray, radio, and ultraviolet radiation. The emission ranges from nuclei of some nearby galaxies emitting about 1040 erg s<sup>-1</sup> to distant quasars emitting more than 1047 erg s<sup>-1</sup>.</p>
                        <p><b>Fun Fact:</b> Active galactic nuclei are the universe's most luminous constant sources of electromagnetic radiation.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading" id="cont-2">The Unified Model for Active Galactic Nuclei</h2>
                        <p>In astronomy, all entities are believed to be identical but viewed from different perspectives. Thus, astronomers have put forth the unified model, which states that the various kinds of active galactic nuclei are the same phenomenon witnessed from diverse angles.</p>
                        <p>The unified model for AGN has a central supermassive black hole surrounded by a gaseous accretion disk of ~ a few light days across. <br>Moving outwards from the center of the AGN, fast-moving gas clouds exist at a distance of ~ 100 light days, known as the 'broad line region.' <br>Continuing outwards, at ~ 100 light-years in diameter, a molecular doughnut or torus of colder gas exists. <br>The 'narrow line region' consists of a stretch of ~ 1000 light-years. It comprises small, low-density gas clouds moving at lower energized velocities.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading" id="cont-3">Discovery and early years</h2>
                        <p>During the first half of the 20th century, photographic observations of nearby galaxies witnessed some distinct signatures of AGN emission, although there was not yet a physical knowledge of the nature of the AGN phenomenon. Some early observations included the first spectroscopic detection of emission lines from the nuclei of NGC 1068 and Messier 81 by Edward Fath (published in 1909). Additional spectroscopic studies by astronomers including Vesto Slipher, Milton Humason, and Nicholas Mayall recorded the existence of exceptional emission lines in some galaxy cores.</p>
                        <p>In 1943, Carl Seyfert published a paper explaining observations of nearby galaxies having radiant cores that were sources of extensive emission lines. This study's Galaxies included NGC 1068, NGC 4151, NGC 3516, and NGC 7469. Active galaxies such as these are known as Seyfert galaxies in recognition of Seyfert's pioneering work.</p>

                        <p>Soviet Armenian astrophysicist Viktor Ambartsumian presented Active Galactic Nuclei in the early 1950s. At the Solvay Conference on Physics in 1958, Ambartsumian delivered a report asserting that "explosions in galactic nuclei generate enormous amounts of mass to be expelled. For these explosions to occur, galactic nuclei must hold bodies of huge mass and unidentified character. From this point forward, Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) became a critical element in theories of galactic evolution."</p>
                        <p>The massive luminosities of these quasars and their unique spectral properties revealed that their power source could not be ordinary stars. Accretion of gas onto a supermassive black hole was proposed as the source of quasars' power in papers by Edwin Salpeter and Yakov Zeldovich in 1964.</p>
                        <p>Only a year after recognizing the redshifts of 3C 273 and 3C 48 in 1963, the concept of energy production by accretion onto a black hole was developed. However, this idea was endorsed gradually, encouraged by discovering black hole X-ray sources in our Galaxy and, more recently, supermassive black holes in the center of the Milky Way and other galaxies. Many inquiries remain as to the formation and fueling of the hole, the geometry of the central regions, the detailed emission mechanisms, the production of jets, and other aspects. The study of AGN will remain a vital part of astronomy for the foreseeable future.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading" id="cont-4">Types of AGNs</h2>
                        <p>AGNs are classified into three different classes on the basis of their distance from earth and the direction of the jets produced:</p>
                        <div>
                            <img class="illus-img" src="../assets/others/active_galactic_nuclie_luv4.png">
                            <p class="img-cap">From our position on Earth, Seyfert galaxies appear much larger since they are much closer–typically tens of millions of light-years away. Quasars and blazars are categorized based on the direction their bright jets point: Quasars’ jets have been detected pointing at a variety of angles, but blazars’ jets are always observed with one of their jets pointing at Earth–much like a flashlight pointing into your eyes. The jets in this image are set off with conical labels. <br><b>Credit:</b> NASA, ESA, CSA, and L. Hustak (STScI).</p>

                            <li><b>Seyfert Galaxies:</b> In 1943, American astronomer Carl Seyfert (1911-1960) lured attention to a handful of spiral galaxies with unusually radiant point-like nuclei. The image shows NGC 4051, one of the foremost Seyfert galaxies to be determined. After that, it was discovered that Seyfert galaxies display an excess of radiation in the far-infrared and at different wavelengths compared to normal galaxies. Even more significantly, this surplus radiation is unstable at some wavelengths, including the optical. The variability suggests that the emission from a Seyfert galaxy must arrive from a minuscule region compared to the cosmos itself.</li>

                                <p><b>Quasars:</b> Their discovery was one of the most unpredictable turns in the history of astronomy. When first identified in 1963, quasars emerged at radio and optical wavelengths as faint, point-like objects with unique optical emission spectra. The name comes from their alternative designations of 'quasi-stellar radio source' (QSR) or 'quasi-stellar object' (QSO), suggesting they correspond to stars in their point-like appearance. Quasars' radiant jets have been observed pointing at a multiplicity of angles.</p>
                                <p>Since quasars are so far away, existing statements of their main light sources cleanse out the galaxies near them. Plus, their distances from Earth mean the light we watch has taken billions of years to travel to us, so we see images of galaxies as they started billions of years ago.</p>

They are inconsistent on timescales of days or less. All are robust and varying radio sources. Blazars, a subclass of quasars, are always observed with one of their jets pointing at Earth (the other, which is not followed, suggests out). Quasars and blazars are both extremely distant, so separating the light from their active galactic nuclei and galaxies is difficult.</li>

                        <p>But one of the biggest questions to be answered is: How are we able to study such extragalactic matter that is billions of light years away from us?</p>
                        <p>One reason we know broadly about active galactic nuclei is via analyses of the gas and dust encircling supermassive black holes known as accretion disks. The particles in these ever-rotating accretion disks near black holes occasionally rub concurrently, producing heat and light. Some of this material is expelled with decisive magnetic fields into jets and winds.</p>
                        <p>Gas and dust washing out from the galaxies in the form of jets can span well above the galaxies' star-filled arms. Winds travel far shorter lengths. Jets and winds can trim off star construction near their courses and farther afield by heating the galaxies' gas. These relations between active supermassive black holes–specifically, the activities operated by their active galactic nuclei–play a vital role in comprehending modern galaxies' origins.</p>
                        <p>The favorably illuminated central regions of Seyfert galaxies frequently obscure the dimmer stars in the disks around the galaxies' hubs. Still, observations made in a spectrum of wavelengths of light have enabled researchers to start to untangle what's occurring near their active galactic nuclei and elsewhere in the interacting galaxies.</p>
                        <div>

                            <p class="img-cap">In visible light, Hercules A looks like a typical elliptical galaxy. In X-ray light, a giant cloud of multimillion-degree gas appears, which has been heated by energy generated by the infall of matter into its central supermassive black hole.

                        <p>These chaotic mashups seem much as you'd expect in visible light: Galaxies converging are distorted or have very radiant cores. It's not until you consider them in X-ray and radio light that you see much more occurring well above the galaxies' spiral arms. As their assertive active galactic nuclei interact, they send out a massive portion of gas–known as jets–in opposing directions. These jets can transit up to millions of miles per hour and grow well above the galaxies' widths, producing giant lobes that are observable in radio light.</p>

The most powerful telescope ever launched into space, its vastly enhanced infrared resolution, and acuity permit it to view objects too old, outlying, or undefined for the Hubble Space Telescope. The James Webb Space Telescope will help us understand what’s occurring near and about active galactic nuclei.</p>
                        <p>To date, we have a span of data concerning active galactic nuclei near and far–but with the James Webb Space Telescope, we will hold high-resolution data in a span of infrared wavelengths for the initial period. This is crucial for two reasons: for nearby marks, infrared light permits us to examine through the gas and dust obstructing the interiors of galaxies, where all the activity is taking place. For faraway targets, the growth of space has also led to light extension for billions of years as it tours to Earth. Although active galactic nuclei may radiate ultraviolet and visible light, this light extends over time into infrared light, pushing Webb’s observations vital since they will deliver high-resolution infrared data about galaxies in the very early universe.</p>
                        <p>We will look at what Webb can do in the mission’s forthcoming release of the first full-color images and data on July 12, 2022.</p>
