            <p>
              Today, practically everyone engages in some type of internet
              activity. We have a lot of things saved—passwords, photos, and so
              on—but where are they all stored? Do we have access to our data
              alone? Do others not know about it? Today, let&#39;s find out.
              Protecting computer systems from cyberattacks, hacking,
              unauthorised access, etc. is known as ethical hackers. use
              cutting-edge technology and a number of additional tools to defend
              computer systems from such attacks. This discipline covers a wide
              range of topics, including user awareness training, malware
              detection and prevention, data encryption, network security, and
              incident response. We require more ethical hackers now that the
              globe is moving more towards online work and business because we
              need professionals to protect our data. Learn more about ethical
              hackers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let&#39;s begin by hacking first. If someone tries to gain
              information from someone but is unsuccessful, and if they are
              skilled at hacking, they can access the person&#39;s mobile
              device, computer, personal information, etc., and learn
              information. When someone tries to obtain information about
              something or someone without having permission, this is referred
              to as hacking.
            </p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">Types of hackers</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong> Black hat hackers: </strong>Black hat hackers, commonly
                referred to as &quot;crackers&quot; or &quot;dark-side
                hackers,&quot; are those who participate in unauthorised actions
                and cyberattacks with the intention of harming others. They do
                it for a variety of reasons, such as wanting to make money or
                intending to ruin someone&#39;s life by publishing intimate
                information about them. Black hat hackers operate secretly since
                their activities are illegal, and they risk severe penalties if
                discovered. Around the world, governments and law enforcement
                organisations are working hard to locate and capture these
                hackers so that people, businesses, and essential
                infrastructures are protected from their damaging activities.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>White hat hackers:</strong>White hat hackers, commonly
                referred to as &quot;ethical hackers,&quot; are those who employ
                their hacking abilities for legitimate and beneficial goals. In
                order to enhance security and defend against possible cyber
                attacks, they strive to detect vulnerabilities and flaws in
                computer systems, networks, and software. Additionally, they are
                authorised to break into the computers of the concerned
                businesses in order to look for vulnerabilities, report them to
                the businesses, and stop black hat hackers from discovering the
                holes first.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Grey hat hackers:</strong>Grey hat hackers are a hybrid
                of white hat and black hat hackers. They participate in hacking
                operations without express permission, but they do not just do
                so with harmful or destructive purposes.Without the owners&#39;
                consent, grey hat hackers frequently find security holes and
                vulnerabilities in computer networks, software, and systems.
                They may take use of these flaws to obtain access without
                authorization or make the flaws known to the public, frequently
                with the goal of raising awareness of the security problems and
                promoting their fix. Grey hat hacking involves activities that
                might be seen as both beneficial and potentially detrimental,
                being within a moral and legal grey area.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="section-heading">
              The steps involved in the penetration testing process, commonly
              referred to as ethical hacking, may be summed up as follows:
            </h2>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Reconnaissance and planning:</strong>An ethical hacker
                acquires data on the target system or network during the
                reconnaissance and planning stage of ethical hacking. Utilising
                tools like Nmap and Shodan to find open ports, services, and
                possible vulnerabilities entails undertaking both passive and
                active reconnaissance to gather information from publicly
                accessible sources. The knowledge acquired aids the hacker in
                planning the remaining penetration test phases, understanding
                the target environment, and locating prospective entry points.
                This step lays the framework for the ethical hacker to continue
                the testing process and concentrate their efforts on areas of
                vulnerability by adhering to legal and ethical limitations.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Scanning:</strong>The goal of ethical hacking&#39;s
                scanning phase is to look for open ports, services, and
                vulnerabilities on the target system or network. This calls for
                the use of several tools, including Nmap, Nessus, and OpenVAS.
                The ethical hacker may identify services and do thorough port
                scanning with Nmap, which helps them comprehend the network
                structure. The scanning step helps identify possible entry
                points by giving crucial information about the target&#39;s
                security posture.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong> Gaining access: </strong>In the gaining access stage of
                ethical hacking, vulnerabilities found during scanning are taken
                advantage of to enter a system without authorization. As well as
                identifying possible security vulnerabilities and making
                suggestions for mitigating them, the objective is to establish
                unauthorised access and sustain persistence within the target
                system or network. In order to assist businesses strengthen
                their security defences, ethical hackers work within the
                confines of the law and moral principles.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong> Maintaining access: </strong>The goal of ethical
                hacking maintaining access phase is to prevent continued
                unauthorised access to the target system or network. This
                entails developing perseverance and keeping control after
                you&#39;ve gained admission. They may learn more, make more
                thorough evaluations, and practise potential real-world assault
                scenarios by keeping access. In this stage, ethical hackers are
                able to find more vulnerabilities, assess the results of their
                activities, and make detailed recommendations on how to improve
                security measures and reduce risks.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Covering / clearing tracks:</strong>The goal of the
                ethical hacking phase known as &quot;covering tracks&quot; is to
                remove or alter any evidence of the activities involved in
                penetration testing. Ethical hackers take measures to get rid of
                any evidence that may point to their involvement in and use of
                the target system or network. The goal is to make sure that the
                customer or organisation may continue regular operations without
                any signs that an ethical hacking engagement ever took place.
                During this stage, ethical hackers follow the law and moral
                principles, refraining from any damaging or malevolent
                behaviour.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Reporting:</strong>A thorough report is created during
                the ethical hacking reporting phase to include the conclusions,
                processes, and suggestions. The report lists the vulnerabilities
                found, their seriousness, and any possible effects they may have
                on the target system or network. The report promotes
                communication, provides transparency, and directs the use of
                required security measures.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Skills for ethical hacking:</h2>
            <p>
              Understanding of web technologies, operating systems, programming
              languages (such Python or C/C++), networking, and VAPT tools like
              Nmap and Burp Suite are prerequisites for ethical hacking. It is
              essential to understand risk analysis, social engineering, and
              cryptography. To stay ahead of emerging dangers, continuous
              learning is required. Strong ethical principles and adherence to
              moral and legal restraints are essential for ethical hackers.
              Through self-study, real-world experience, and certifications like
              CEH, OSCP, or GPEN, skills can be built. Ethical hackers are
              essential in spotting weaknesses, boosting cybersecurity, and
              shielding organisations from dangerous actors since they have
              honed these capabilities.
            </p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              In conclusion, ethical hacking is an essential technique that
              tries to find and fix weaknesses in computer networks, software,
              and systems. White hat hackers, sometimes referred to as ethical
              hackers, use their expertise to carry out approved and regulated
              penetration testing. They aid organisations in identifying flaws
              and possible security holes by simulating real- world attack
              scenarios. In order to proactively improve cybersecurity and stop
              unauthorised access, data breaches, and other cyber dangers,
              ethical hacking is essential. Ethical hackers help organisations
              strengthen their defences, safeguard sensitive data, and reduce
              risks by providing thorough reports and practical advice. By
              encouraging trust, resilience, and the protection of people,
              companies, and vital infrastructures, ethical hacking helps make
              the internet a safer place.
