                        <!-- Main Content/ Article Body -->
                        
                        <p>CRISPR was discovered in the mid-1990s by scientists studying the genome of the bacterium Escherichia coli (E. coli). The scientists noticed repeating sequences in the genome that are separated by short, non-repeating sequences and referred to these repeating sequences as “clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats,” or CRISPR.</p>
                        
                        <p>The first use of CRISPR as a tool for gene editing was developed by Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier in 2012. The two scientists developed a method for using CRISPR to precisely cut and edit specific sequences of DNA, which has the potential to revolutionize the field of medicine and has sparked significant scientific and ethical debate. Considering recent events, CRISPR has proved itself as a worthy opponent to the raging disease, COVID-19.</p>
                        
                        <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has caused widespread illness and death, with the virus primarily spreading through respiratory droplets when an infected person talks, coughs, or sneezes. One approach to fighting the virus is to use CRISPR to target and disable specific genes in the virus itself. For example, researchers have used CRISPR to target and knock out the gene that codes the spike protein, which the virus uses to enter human cells. By disrupting the gene, researchers hope to prevent the virus from replicating and spreading. In that case, the application of CRISPR may also be used to bolster the human immune system.</p>
                        
                        <p>The human body has its own natural defenses against viruses, including T cells and B cells, which can recognize and attack the virus. However, these immune cells can sometimes struggle to effectively recognize and attack the virus, leading to a slower or weaker immune response. Researchers are exploring the use of CRISPR to edit the genes of these immune cells to enhance their ability to recognize and attack the virus. This approach has the potential to improve the body’s natural defenses against the virus and potentially reduce the severity of illness.</p>
                        
                        <p>CRISPR is also being explored as a potential treatment for individuals who have already been infected with COVID-19. The application of this tool edits the genes of cells in the respiratory tract, such as epithelial cells, to make them more resistant to the virus. This could potentially help to prevent the virus from taking hold and replicating in the respiratory tract, reducing the severity of the illness.</p>
                        
                        <p>There are a variety of uses that allow for CRISPR to help in not just COVID-19 but in other diseases and future diseases as well. While CRISPR has the potential to be a powerful tool in the fight against COVID-19, it is important to note that these applications are still in the early stages of development and much more research is needed to determine their safety and effectiveness. Additionally, there are ethical considerations surrounding the use of CRISPR, as it involves altering an individual’s genetic material, which raises concerns about the long-term effects and unintended consequences. Thus, CRISPR in the future raises a big question in the realm of bioethics and how we perceive the idea of making people ``better.” A safety concern is something to consider as well, as there are still unknowns about its long-term safety and potential side effects. There is a risk of off-target effects, where CRISPR may inadvertently edit other genes, leading to unintended consequences.</p>
                        
                        <p>Gene editing tools, such as CRISPR, have sparked significant debate due to the potential to make precise and permanent changes to an individual’s genetic material. These tools have the potential to revolutionize the field of medicine and have several potential applications, including the treatment of genetic disorders and the enhancement of the human immune system. However, the use of gene editing tools also raises a few ethical and safety concerns.</p>
                        
                        <p>One argument in favor of gene editing tools is the potential to treat and cure genetic disorders. These tools have the potential to be used to edit specific genes that cause genetic disorders, such as sickle cell disease and cystic fibrosis. By editing these genes, it may be possible to cure or alleviate the symptoms of these disorders. This could have a significant impact on the lives of individuals with these conditions and their families. Likewise, gene editing tools can be at the forefront to improve public health. These tools have the potential to be used to prevent the transmission of certain genetic disorders, such as hemophilia, from one generation to the next. This could help to reduce the incidence of these conditions and improve public health.</p>
                        
                        <p>Overall, the ethical implication of CRISPR is complex and it is important for researchers and policymakers to carefully consider the potential risks and benefits of this technology.</p>
