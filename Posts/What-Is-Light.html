                        <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>For hundreds of years , scientists debated the nature of light. and ever since the physics community witnessed one of the biggest arguments and craziest interpretations of all times.<br>
In this article we will shift through the history of the interpretations of light given by scientists</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Newton’s corpuscles</h2>
                        <p>At that time scientists such as Hooke and Hyugen argued that light is a wave that traveled through luminiferous ether, but their rival sir Isaac Newton argued that their theory was none other than some nonsense, since light travels through the vacuum. He then proposed that light is a stream of small particles called corpuscles, and as the president of the royal society people leaned more to his side and believed in his assumption for over a hundred years.<br>He could explain more properties of light such as refraction, reflection, and transmission depending on the density, and state of matter of the surface in his Opticks book .<br>Nevertheless there were some challenges that faced his theory as it couldn’t explain other properties of light such as interference and polarization.</p>
                        
                        <h4>The double slit experiment</h4>
                        <p>Thomas Young proposed a simple yet brilliant experiment that crashed down Newton’s theory of corpuscles. the scientific community -being a bunch of newtonians- therefore refused his experiment<br>The experiment requires a light source, a screen with two slits, and an optical screen. We start by emitting light towards the slit and observe the shape it will leave on the optical screen.<br>If Newton was right about the nature of light the particles detected at the screen must take a linear direction through the slits and fall on the screen in the shape presented in the following figure<br>But the light showed a property only waves have which is  called the wave interference ( the wave interference is basically when two or more waves pass through each other and  create a bigger wave ) like so presented in the figure</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Fresnel and Poisson’s spot</h2>
                        <p>In 1818 l’académie des sciences de Paris proposed a competition in aim to explain the diffraction of light, at that time the science community still sticked to Newton’s corpuscles, what they did not expect is for the winner to emphasis the behavior of light to be that of a wave, that’s what fresnel did as he explained that the diffraction of light is due to its wave nature. SiméonDenis Poisson was one of the examiners of the committee, as well as being a believer of Newton's corpuscular theory. He explained that if Fresnel was right that would mean that the rays from shining sources towards circular or spherical objects would bend towards a single point in the center of the shadow, and would form a brighter spot because of the interference of light, which seemed so absurd to him he didn't bother trying the experiment it himself. However, François Arago , who was the head of the committee, was drawn to this idea because he believed more in the wave nature of light, so he performed  the experiment and it ended just as Poisson predicted. <br>This experiment is sometimes referred to as Fresnel’s spot or even Arago's spot, but the most frequent name for it is “ Poisson’s spot “.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Maxwell’s electromagnetic waves</h4>
                        <p>James Clerk Maxwell was invested in electromagnetic waves, which are the disturbances created by electrical oscillations that superpose with magnetic oscillations. He calculated their speed and found it was similar to that of light, so he concluded that light must be an electromagnetic wave. “Light is an electromagnetic disturbance in the form of waves propagated through the electromagnetic field according to electromagnetic laws”. He classified light in the electromagnetic spectrum as visible light.All of the electromagnetic waves have the same speed which is 3*10^8 m.s^-1 but differ in wavelengths and frequencies</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">light quanta/ photons</h2>
                        <p>Maxwell theory was very useful but couldn’t explain the photoelectric effect which is when an electromagnetic wave is directed towards a metal plate an electron will be ejected and that depended on its frequency hence energy planck formed an equation explaining that the energy is equal to the frequency times planck’s constant: E=hv.<br>Einstein proposed further explanation in the photoelectric effects by explaining
that light is quantized, so the electron is ejected when it’s struck by a singular light quantum with enough energy
<br>Einstein believed that light is a massless particle (photon) kind of a packet of energy and its flow is that of a wave. He however didn’t name the light quantum photons; it was suggested by Gilbert Newton lewis in 1926.<br>Until this day the physics community settled for einstein’s assumption of photons, but research and studies kept on flowing in quantum physics to explain some of the missing points of einstein’s paper such the correlation of the photons momentum </p>
                        
                        <h4>The double slit experiment and photons</h4>
                        <p>The double slit experiment has yet brought more complications to the light theory. Einstein figured out the photons to be the unit quantity of light and we already knew from previous experiences that streaming light through a double slit will leave a wave interference âttern in the screen. But what if we emit each photon on its own through a slit randomly?<br>Even when each photon is emitted individually the screen will mark up an interference pattern which means that the photon interfered with itself and passed through both slits at once. Therefore scientists fixed detectors in the experiment to detect how the photons interfere when passing through the slits, but this time the photons changed completely the way their pattern as they left a particle like spectra instead of the interference pattern it usually takes, which meant they passed through one of the slits instead of both of them. Photons change their behavior when being observed as if they are conscious of it<br>Richard Feynman said that this final observation implies that the double slit experiment can be implemented in the quantum mechanics world as it is impossible to explain it by classical physics. Bohr’s Copenhagen's interpretation states that particles exist in all physical states until they are being observed and then all the possibilities crash into one which the particle takes; likewise observing photons forces it to choose a definite state which ends up acting as a particle. Einstein rejected completely this idea as he thought it made the world act in complete random<br>But, until today, no one can explain the behavior of photons.</p>
