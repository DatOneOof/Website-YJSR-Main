                        <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>Data(plural-datum) is any set of information. It plays an essential role in our lives. We each consume and produce huge amounts of information each day, and it can be used in industries as diverse as healthcare, banking, marketing, transportation, institutions and many more. However, such sensitive information needs to be protected, which is where ethical hacking comes into play. But what is Ethical Hacking?</p>
                        <p>Ethical Hacking is typically used to protect any organisation from unethical(black and grey hat) hackers. Throughout our life, most of the times we see hackers in a negative shade, but there exists a job and a very bright future in this field as it is the primary shield to protect any organisations’ credentials.</p>
                        <p>But can hacking really be a good task? What is ethical hacking and how it’s different from other kinds of hacking? Who are ethical hackers and how do you get started as one? And why would a company willingly say Yes to being hacked?</p>
                        <p>I’ll be  giving you answers to all of these questions in this article.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">What is Hacking?</h2>
                        <p>At its simplest, hacking is gaining access to a digital device, computer system, or network in an unauthorised or unintended way.</p>
                        <p>Hacking has a wide variety of applications—both good and bad—but it’s easy to see how hacking could be used for malicious purposes.</p>
                        <p>Similar to how leaving your door unlocked or your window wide open could leave you vulnerable to burglars, hackers can exploit security vulnerabilities in a device, network, or software to gain entry.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">What is Ethical Hacking?</h2>
                        <p>An ethical hacker, also known as a white hat hacker, is a cybersecurity expert who tries to find security vulnerabilities to gain access to a digital device, computer system, or network.</p>
                        <p>Sounds like any other kind of hacking, right?</p>
                        <p>The difference is that a white hat hacker uses hacking skills to help companies find ways to strengthen their security. A black hat hacker uses hacking skills to exploit weaknesses for personal gain.</p>
                        <p>A true ethical hacker only starts hacking after receiving explicit permission from the owner.</p>
                        <p>The goal of ethical hacking is to evaluate the existing security system and find ways to strengthen and improve protection. When an ethical hacker finds vulnerabilities in a company’s software, the company can then resolve the issues before a malicious hacker can exploit them.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Roles of Ethical Hackers</h2>
                        <p>
                            Their duties can include: 
                            <ul>
                                <li>Assessing vulnerabilities</li>
                                <li>Penetration testing</li>
                                <li>Gathering intelligence about entry points</li>
                                <li>Scanning infrastructures to spot weaknesses</li>
                                <li>Accessing systems/networks and exploiting vulnerabilities</li>
                                <li>Hiding their access and evading detection</li>
                                <li>Compiling reports and analysis for the attempts</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Different Types of Hackers</h2>
                        <h3>1. Black Hat Hackers</h3>
                        <p>Late one night, a group of people sneaks into a museum without setting off the alarm. They avoid detection by sneaking in at the perfect time while the security guards are changing shifts.</p>
                        <p>The group manages to steal several rare and expensive paintings and get away without being caught. They make a large amount of money by selling those paintings on the black market.</p>
                        <p>It’s pretty obvious that this scenario describes illegal and malicious activities. This example is similar to how a black hat hacker could bypass a business’s cybersecurity system to gain unauthorized access to confidential files in order to sell the illegally obtained information.</p>
                        <p>Black hat hackers are those who hack illegally for self-gain or malicious purposes. This includes anyone who steals, leaks, accesses data, or disrupts computer devices and systems for malicious intent, financial gain, or any other motive.</p>
                        <p>The term “black hat” actually stems from old western movies where the criminal would be identified by his black attire and the hero would be recognized by his white hat.</p>
                        <h3>2. White Hat Hackers</h3>
                        <p>A museum wants to know how well its security systems function. The museum director is concerned that the museum may be vulnerable to thieves but doesn’t know the best way to improve security.</p>
                        <p>The museum director hires a security expert to help detect vulnerabilities in the system. The security expert will recreate a real-life scenario by trying to break into the museum. The security expert and the museum director both sign a written agreement.</p>
                        <p>The security expert is able to break in one night by bypassing the alarm and avoiding the security guards while they change shifts.</p>
                        <p>The following morning, the security expert delivers a report to the museum director explaining how he was able to sneak in and outlining ways that the museum could fix the vulnerabilities that he identified.</p>
                        <p>In this example, no laws were broken and no malicious activity occurred. This is similar to how a white hat hacker can use ethical hacking to help businesses improve their cybersecurity and avoid future malicious hacking.</p>
                        <p>It’s easy to see how true white hat hackers are completely different from black hat hackers. But what about scenarios where things aren’t so black and white?</p>
                        <p>There are other kinds of hackers who don’t have malicious intentions but don’t hold themselves to the same moral standards as true ethical hackers. We call these people gray hat hackers.</p>
                        <h3>3. Gray Hat Hackers</h3>
                        <p>An art-loving security expert is concerned that a local museum doesn’t have strong enough security to protect its rare collection. The security expert writes a letter to the museum director but receives no response.</p>
                        <p>The security expert doesn’t break or harm anything. Instead, he leaves an anonymous letter on the museum director’s desk explaining how he was able to bypass the security system and outlining ways to improve the museum’s security.</p>
                        <p>If no changes are made, the security expert plans to announce the museum’s security flaws to the public in the hopes that the museum director will be forced to finally improve security.</p>
                        <p>This example makes it clear how the line between black hat and white hat hackers can get blurry. Ethical hacking is about more than just having good intentions.</p>
                        <p>As we will see later on, an unauthorized intrusion is still an unauthorized intrusion regardless of whether or not the hacker was trying to be helpful.</p>
                        <p>Although all hackers draw from the same skills and knowledge, true ethical hackers only use their abilities to gain access to systems with the explicit permission of the owners.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Why is Ethical Hacking Important?</h2>
                        <p>
                            <ol class="cont-list">
                                <li>They figure out loopholes and fix them before the unethical hackers can take advantage of it.</li>
                                <li>As well as the loss of data and money, cybercrime can harm public safety, damage economies, and undermine national security. Evidently, it’s essential to protect organisations and their data, and ethical hacking can play a crucial role in this protection.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Types of Ethical Hacking</h2>
                        <ul class="cont-list">
                            <li><i>Web application hacking:</i> Web applications are shared over a network (such as the internet or an intranet) and are sometimes browser-based. Although convenient, they can be vulnerable to scripting attacks, and ethical hackers test such weaknesses.</li>
                            <li><i>Web server hacking:</i> Web servers run operating systems and applications that host web pages and connect to back-end databases. There are potential weak points at each point of this process, which ethical hackers must test, identify, and recommend fixes.</li>
                            <li><i>Wireless network hacking:</i> We’re all familiar with wireless networks – a group of computers that are wirelessly connected to a central access point. However, with this convenience comes a variety of potential security flaws that white-hat hackers must look for.</li>
                            <li><i>System hacking:</i> Accessing a secure network is one thing, but system hacking focuses on gaining access to individual computers on a network. Ethical hackers will try and do precisely this while also suggesting appropriate countermeasures.</li>
                            <li><i>Social engineering:</i> While the other methods focus on accessing information through computers, systems and networks, social engineering targets individuals. Often, this means manipulating people to hand over sensitive data or provide access without them suspecting ill intent.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">What must you learn to become an Ethical Hacker?</h2>
                        <p>
                            An ethical hacker is a  computer expert, who specializes in networking and penetration testing. This generally entails the following skill set –
                            <ul class="cont-list">
                                <li>Expertise in various operating systems, primarily Linux and its various distribution. This is because a good portion of vulnerability testing includes invading the target system and sifting through their system. This is impossible without a good grasp on operating systems.</li>
                                <li>In-depth knowledge of networking is also key to a successful ethical hacking career. This involves packet tracking, packet sniffing, intrusion detection & prevention, scanning subnets etc.</li>
                                <li>Programming: Now programming is a vast topic with nuances in every language. As an ethical hacker, it is not expected of you to be a master-coder, but rather be a jack-of-all-trades.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>Below is a table of the major/commonly used programming languages. Knowing these will definitely help you as an ethical hacker:</p>

                        <p>It is impossible to go over every ethical hacking tool out there in a single article, hence, I’ll just be going over some of the really famous ones in this section:</p>
                        <p><i><b>Nmap</b></i> <br>Nmap, short for Network Mapper, is a reconnaissance tool that is widely used by ethical hackers to gather information about a target system. This information is key to deciding the proceeding steps to attack the target system. Nmap is cross-platform and works on Mac, Linux, and Windows. It has gained immense popularity in the hacking community due to its ease of use and powerful searching & scanning abilities.</p>
                        <p><i><b>Netsparker</b></i> <br>Netsparker is a web application security testing tool. Netsparker finds and reports web application vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection and Cross-site Scripting (XSS) on all types of web applications, regardless of the platform and technology they are built with. Netsparker’s unique and dead accurate Proof-Based Scanning technology does not just report vulnerabilities, it also produces a Proof-of-Concept to confirm they are not false positives. Freeing you from having to double check the identified vulnerabilities.</p>
                        <p>
                            <i><b>Burpsuite</b></i> <br>Burp Suite is a Java-based Web Penetration Testing framework. It has become an industry standard suite of tools used by information security professionals. Burp Suite helps you identify vulnerabilities and verify attack vectors that are affecting web applications. Burp Suit’s unquestionable acceptance and fame can be attributed to the fantastic web application crawler. It can –

                                <li>Accurately map content and functionality</li>
                                <li>Automatically handling sessions</li>
                                <li>Handles all sorts of state changes, volatile content, and application logins</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p><i><b>Metasploit</b></i> <br>Metasploit is an open-source pen-testing framework written in Ruby.  It acts as a public resource for researching security vulnerabilities and developing code that allows a network administrator to break into his own network to identify security risks and document which vulnerabilities need to be addressed first. It is also one of the few tools used by beginner hackers to practice their skills. It also allows you to replicate websites for phishing and other social engineering purposes.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Types of Ethical Hacking</h2>
                        <p>There are several roles associated with ethical hacking, the scope of which can vary depending on your area of expertise and the organisation/sector you’re working in. Some of the most popular ethical hacking jobs include:</p>
                        <ul class="cont-list">
                            <li><i>Penetration tester:</i> As mentioned previously, pen testers perform authorised tests on computers and networks to identify weaknesses. Penetration testers will often specialise in one particular type of system.</li>
                            <li><i>Computer crime investigator:</i> This role focuses more on what happens after data breaches take place. They investigate a wide range of crimes, from hacking to other types of illegal activity.</li>
                            <li><i>Data security analyst:</i> A data or cyber security analyst is usually an in-house role that focuses on identifying potential weaknesses within an IT system. They will then implement measures to prevent breaches, such as creating firewalls and encryption.</li>
                            <li><i>Network administrator:</i> This role also focuses on maintaining computer networks and solving any problems they encounter. As well as installing and configuring networks, they help identify and solve any issues that occur within systems.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>There has never been a better time to learn ethical hacking and penetration testing, since ethical hacking is a fascinating branch of cyber security. For those interested in ethical hacking, there has never been a better time to do so. It is expected that the demand for people who possess these skills will continue to increase as cyber attacks continue to become more expensive. In addition to paying well, ethical hacking jobs tend to be stable in their careers. As companies become more interconnected, more opportunities exist for security breaches. vulnerabilities to be exploited. This may be bad news for organizations, but it is good news for those considering careers as ethical hackers and pentesters.</p>
