                        <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>In today's world it is a necessity to learn the meaning of radioactivity and nuclear energy in order to understand its extensions, blessings, and dangers. In this article we will discuss a variety of aspects of this topic.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">What is Radioactivity?</h2>
                        <p>Radioactivity mainly serves radiation activity. <br>We know that radiation is the release of energy in the form of moving waves or streams of particles, so radioactivity is a characteristic behavior of unstable nucleus of atoms spontaneously decaying to different nuclei which leads to a great emission of radiation, which we also call that radioactive decay. These unstable atoms which are isotopes are basically atoms with either too many or too little amount of neutrons compared to protons and they try to regain their stability by decaying. <br>In nature there are three main types of decay: alpha decay, beta decay, and gamma decay. Nevertheless there are some other types of decay that we are gonna introduce in this chapter such as: positron decay, electron capture, and fission.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Alpha particle</h2>
                        <p>The alpha particle is a helium nucleus consisting of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, when the isotope has too many nuclei it tends to split to give an alpha particle and another atom, this way it regains its stability.</p>
                        <div>
                            <img class="illus-img" src="../assets/others/radioactivity_ hrishita1.png">
                            <p class="img-cap">Figure 1: Alpha Particle</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>The  properties of an alpha particle are:</p>
                        <p><b>It is Monoenergetic:</b> After each decay there is an amount of energy released which is usually shared between the new particles, but since the helium particle is much smaller than the other particle it essentially gets most of the energy.This means that no matter how many times we make an alpha decay of the same type of isotope we will get the same energy.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Beta Particle</h2>
                        <h3>Beta Minus</h3>
                        <p>A beta particle is an electron <sub>-1</sub>e<sup>0</sup> with zero nuclei and a negative charge. <br>A nucleus that has an excessive amount of neutrons will go through a beta minus decay in which it emits an electron, by changing the neutron to a proton, an electron, and an antineutrino.</p>
                        <div>
                            <img class="illus-img" src="../assets/others/radioactivity_ hrishita2.png">
                            <p class="img-cap">Figure 2: Beta Decay</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>Unlike the alpha particle, the emitted particles aren’t monoenergetic, since the energy is split between the three new particles. In fact the scientists only detected the presence of the antineutrino because the energy of the experiment kept changing results after every decay hence, they concluded that there must be a teeny tiny particle almost massless that has no charge, so they called it a neutrino. In this beta minus decay it is the antimatter of a neutrino which is an antineutrino.</p>
                        <h3>Beta Plus/Positron Decay</h3>
                        <p>Now if an isotope has an excessive amount of protons over neutrons, the excessive protons will change to a neutron and emit with them a positron and a neutrino. <br>A positron is an antimatter electron; it means they have the same properties except for the charge which is the opposite of an electron.  The particles of this decay also aren’t  monoenergetic, so the amount of charge released will change between these particles after each decay.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Gamma Ray</h2>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 3px;">
                            Let us consider the example of:
                            <div style="margin-bottom: 3px; text-align: center;"><i><sub>55</sub>Cs<sup>137</sup> &RightArrow; <sub>56</sub>Ba<sup>137*</sup> + <sub>-1</sub>e<sup>0</sup> + -ve(514 MeV)</i></div>
                            The * refers to an excited state which leads the atom to release a great amount of energy as a gamma ray. Just like the electron phenomen a photon is emitted when an electron transports from its orbit to the next one, it is the same concept in the nucleus: the particles are built in shells when a decay of some type occurs. 
                        </p>
                        <div>
                            <img class="illus-img" src="../assets/others/radioactivity_ hrishita3.png">
                            <p class="img-cap">Figure 3: Emission of Gamma Photon</p>
                        </div>
                        <p style="margin-bottom: 3px;">
                            There is a great chance it will leave the atom in great excitement as a new atom so it emits another type of decay to lose that energy as the follow:
                            <div style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px;"><i><sub>56</sub>Ba<sup>137*</sup> + <sub>-1</sub>e<sup>0</sup> + -ve(514 MeV) &RightArrow; Ba + e + ve(514 MeV) + &gamma;</i></div>
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Fission</h2>
                        <p>Fission decay, is when an isotope splits into two smaller nuclei, neutrons and gamma rays are usually ejected in the process as well, a great energy is produced due to this decay even to the standard of radioactivity, fission is used in nuclear reactors and in atomic bombs.</p>
                        <div>
                            <img class="illus-img" src="../assets/others/radioactivity_ hrishita4.png">
                            <p class="img-cap">Figure 4: Nuclear Fission</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>In a nuclear bomb they bombard a neutron to an unstable uranium atom releasing other neutrons that would do the same thing with other uranium isotopes.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Electron Capture</h2>
                        <p>An electron capture is an electron from the inner orbit of an atom that gets captured and reacted by one of the protons in the nucleus causing an emission of neutron and a neutrino.</p>
                        <div>
                            <img class="illus-img" src="../assets/others/radioactivity_ hrishita5.gif">
                            <p class="img-cap">Figure 5: Electron Capture</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            Unlike the other decays this one isn’t dangerous since the neutrino is the only particle emitted out of the atom and it is very hard to detect. There are two possibilities of which the atom can undergo after this decay:
                            <ol class="cont-list">
                                <li><b>Gamma Decay:</b> Because the nucleus is usually in an excited state it can undergo a gamma decay.</li>
                                <li><b>X-Ray Emission:</b> Since one electron is missing because of the electron capture, another electron would drop to its level to replace it, this will emit an x-ray photon.</li>
                            </ol>
                            Like the alpha decay in both cases the particles are monoenergetic.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Nuclear Energy</h2>
                        <p>As we discussed before, nuclear decays emit a huge deal of energy, of which scientists had big ambitions for after the 1940s. The idea of nuclear power could promise almost everybody free electricity, advanced technologies and a cleaner environment, as nuclear energy does not produce air pollution or carbon dioxide while operating. Nevertheless, that enthusiasm was alleviated since the reactors were very expensive to build and they struggled on transforming the physics into engineering. One of the examples of nuclear reactors is the light water reactor.</p>
                        <h3>The Light Water Reactor:</h3>
                        <p>Although it wasn’t the scientists’ favorite option, the light water reactor proved to be efficient, simple and less expensive than the other reactors. The process consists of heating water by a core of radioactive uranium, the water circulates to a turban that extracts its energy and transforms it to power through a generator that produces electricity to the city.</p>
                        <div>
                            <img class="illus-img" src="../assets/others/radioactivity_ hrishita6.gif">
                            <p class="img-cap">Figure 6: The Light Water Reactor</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>The light water reactor became very popular as it was effective and economical, however, it did possess a lot of dangers which were evident especially after some accidents such as Chernobyl (1986)  and  Fukushima Daiichi (2011).</p>
