                        <p>We, as humans, have always admired beauty, no matter its form. Taking a small butterfly as an example, we follow its path without looking and only notice when it's gone. We feel sad, unmotivated, and devastated as the gone butterfly defines our worth.</p>
                        <p>How does beauty influence human beings?</p>
                        <p>Why did I choose butterflies after all? There are a lot of mesmerizing things, and you chose a butterfly?</p>
                        <p>Let's discover it together, taking one step at a time.</p>
                        
                        <p>We definitely watched Disney cartoons as kids and loved the stories our grandmas used to tell us before bed. We had biases and cried when our kindergartener's lunch wasn't themed with our favorite character. We grew up with these ideals, and they slowly became our reality. How's that even possible, you'll say?</p>
                        
                        <p>When we watch something we like, our brains release oxytocin, dopamine, serotonin, and endorphins. Which makes us attached to the specific memory and forms a habit. By time, the ideas we consume become our reality as our subconscious minds believe in the messages we receive throughout the day. And it results in major changes in beauty standards. Crazy right, how some innocent cartoons can change the future adults view of themselves and resolutely enter this huge percentile of mental health disorders and suicide attempts, which sadly ended a lot of precious lives.</p>
                        
                        <p>So,we admit that what we were upringed with changed our whole lives, especially on the inside, in our hearts and souls. Some unfair standards force you to adapt and change your true form in order to fit in with society, or you will be made fun of, even by your closest ones.</p>
                        <p>But we can see it from the economic perspective now. The beauty industry generates a fortune that puts food on the table for millions. From sewers, factory workers, designers, influencers, business owners, and even the customers themselves. Sad but true, sometimes your looks interfere in your work life, especially when you are aspiring to be a public speaker or a representative of some organization. I'm not saying that only "pretty" people will be recruited, what's the worth of an empty jewellery box right, but they have a better percentile.</p>
                        <p>We can't destroy a trillion-dollar industry, one that we interact with everywhere,so we had to live with these unrealistic rules. Here the health industry came to a simple resolution: we can perform a surgery to change what you want at the cost of your long-term health and your money. It seems better than a dream for a lot, a key to living the "perfect" life they never and never will have. Finding the courage to talk for some people, or the partner they desire to live with forever, a job, or even to feel "accepted" by a changing society.</p>
                        <p>There are some studies that show that people get hooked on instant dopamine released by social media and consume their feed full of these standards, which affects our self-esteem directly, our focus, our time, our general health, and especially our views with the ones they choose us to see. Impersonating every small detail you do daily, making you feel alienated by not following the crowd, and raising hate comments when an innocent boy posts a picture of his graduation post, calling him with the devilish words that grow with him even when he doesn't want to and cause him trauma and self-isolation</p>
                        <p>Here comes the butterfly effect: the person who's used to social media to attain their dopamine daily recharge turns into an instant heartburn; you will become fragile day by day; your self-worth will be tied to their likes and preferences.</p>
                        <p>I am not denying that I am actually impressed by plastic surgery, and my younger self always wanted to perform some, but with time, I healed. As a child and teenager, I've always consumed Asian shows such as kdrama and anime, until I became the consumed one. South Korea, especially, has no hatred towards any nation or community; we are all beautiful, but they have the most toxic beauty standards ever, taking first place in suicide rates. You'll even hear of a 100-year-old grandmother suicide there because of the hate they consume every day.</p>
                        <p>How can a country like South Korea, a nation that's known for its innovation and technology and is a leading part of the film, music, and TV industries, have the highest suicide rates on earth?</p>
                        <p>If we search on Google for Mapo Bridge, you will think that it's just a place for tourists and Korean people to see the beauty of the river. Yet, it's known as" the bridge of death" . The government put rolling ends on each side of the river with motivational messages to make them feel better and not give up.</p>
                        <p>The workaholic mindset and "perfectionism" they are known for consumed their health and crushed their souls, making "vitamin supplements" a culture instead of taking normal food. Being highly afraid of gaining weight and putting plastic surgery and makeup on their first priorities to escape the world they took a part in creating, a world full of lies.</p>
                        <p>The workaholic mindset and "perfectionism" they are known for consumed their health and crushed their souls, making "vitamin supplements" a culture instead of taking normal food. Being highly afraid of gaining weight and putting plastic surgery and makeup on their first priorities to escape the world they took a part in creating, a world full of lies.</p>
                        <p>When it comes to people who have undergone plastic surgery, everyone feels different as people have various personas. 83% of regretful customers isn't a good ratio; as it shows in Medical Accident Group Research, this percentile wouldn't consider making a second attempt to change their bodies.</p>
                        <p>And in the end, a butterfly only sees the others' colorful wings and dies without knowing the beauty within her soft soul and mesmerizing ones. The same applied for millions, if not billions, of innocent humans that I was almost a part of some years ago. I am here as a voice to help you guys, as my readers, as my friends, as my big family, know this simple phrase. Why fit in when you can stand out?</p>
                        <p>Nefertiti, Cloopatre VII, Noor Jahal (Monghol),, the famous Helen of Troy, Nandi of the Zulu Kingdom, The Queen of Sheba, Yang Guifei, and billions of other names that history failed to mention They were all beautiful, not because they were adjusted to their beauty standards; it's because they stood out of the crowd by accepting and learning how to love themselves.</p>
                        <p>Conclusion: True beauty is variation. We just need to accept it, refuse anything that hurts us internally, and try to help those in need of us: those who still can't look at themselves in the mirror, those who can't stand looking barefaced without feeling low,and those who were discriminated against because of their beauty.</p>
