                        <p>According to The National Institute of Mental Health, depression is considered one of the most widespread diseases in the United States, with an estimated 19.4 million adults having at least one major depressive episode in 2019 [1]. Depression is a complex brain disorder in which the mood of a person is affected, also known as a mood disorder. Some symptoms of this condition include feeling lethargic, irritable, guilty, having difficulty enjoying life, mood swings, and sometimes suicidal thoughts. There are hundreds of millions of people who suffer from major depressive disorder globally, leading to this being a widely studied disorder with a large emphasis on treatment. The economic burden of depressive disorder among US adults was an estimated $236 billion in 2018, with an increase of more than 35% since 2010, according to research published in the journal Pharmacoeconomics [2]. Huge amounts of money are spent on antidepressants each year, many of which also have disruptive side-effects such as headaches, anxiousness, dizziness, and nausea. In the last decade, however, there have been a number of studies that have examined the linkage between specific dietary nutrients and depression. The most promising research has shown light on two healthy fatty acids: omega-3 and omega-6.</p>
                        
                        <p>Omega-3 fatty acids are polyunsaturated fatty acids characterized by the presence of a double bond. Two of the three main types of omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are found in fish oil. Including fish oil or omega-3s in your diet has been shown to benefit most people and in some cases help prevent heart disease and stroke, help control lupus, eczema, and rheumatoid arthritis, and may play protective roles in cancer and other conditions [3]. The question is, can this be used to prevent or treat mood disorders such as depression?</p>
                        
                        <p>In 2017, researchers at the University of Texas conducted a meta-analysis of 26 clinical trials collectively involving 2,160 participants, which examined the efficacy of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), especially DHA and EPA, on the improvement of depression [4]. Overall, their analysis showed a beneficial effect of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on depression symptoms, with EPA ≥ 60% at a dosage of ≤1 g/d. This has been corroborated by researchers at Harvard Health who found that the ratio of EPA to DHA is an important determinant of effectiveness [5]. The most effective preparations appear to have at least 60% EPA relative to DHA. They arrived at several other conclusions: DHA is thought to be less effective as an antidepressant, but it may have protective effects against suicide; depressed individuals who are overweight and have elevated inflammatory activity may be particularly good candidates for EPA treatment; and Omega-3’s have also shown promising results for other mood disorders like postpartum depression and manic depression.</p>
                        
                        <p>Several reasons for the effectiveness of omega-3 have been proposed [6]. First, omega-3s can easily travel through the brain cell membrane and interact with mood-related neurotransmitters inside the brain by reducing neuroinflammation and oxidative damage, and improving insulin signaling, all of which may help boost mood and prevent symptoms of depression. Cell membranes are partly made out of omega-3s, and therefore your brain needs the type of fatty acids found in omega-3s for proper functioning. Therefore, it may be possible that increasing omega-3 levels makes it easier for serotonin, a chemical messenger that carries messages between brain cells, to pass through cell membranes. While more extensive research is needed to prove this, researchers believe that those who experience depression may not have enough EPA and DHA. In a study [7] examining 247 healthy adults, an increased amount of EPA and DHA intake was found to increase gray matter in those regions of the brain with an important role in regulating depression and other mood disorders.</p>
                        
                        <p>Omega-3 by itself seems to be effective, however, there has also been a lot of research to study the effectiveness of omega-3 along with omega-6. Omega-6 is another type of polyunsaturated fat found in vegetable oils, nuts, and seeds. The formation of neurotransmitters is affected by the proportion of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, which is very important in the maintenance and regulation of normal functioning of the brain. In general, increased levels of omega-6 versus omega-3 proportions were found in those with major depression, than in those having no signs of depression or minor depression. A Rotterdam study of 3,884 individuals for depressive symptoms at an age of 60 years or older [8], found that patients who experienced severe symptoms of depression contain a low concentration of omega-3 fatty acids and a considerably higher concentration of omega-6 fatty acids. This also connects with real-world evidence. Relative proportions of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, often endemic in the diet, may help explain the low prevalence of mood disorders in Asian countries, where large levels of fatty fish are consumed, compared to rates in the United States and Europe, where elevated levels of saturated fat are often consumed.</p>
                        
                        <p>In conclusion, researchers have been studying the effects that omega-3 and omega-6 may have on depression, as well as other mental and behavioral conditions. As a whole, as far as omega-3 by itself is concerned, research shows certain dosages and proportions of EPA to DHA do have benefits specifically for certain types of depression. Furthermore, increased levels of omega-6 and omega-3 seem to be linked to elevated symptoms of depression. However, researchers have pointed to the need for larger studies in order to support these conclusions more widely and across more representative sets of the global population. The research on omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids could have revolutionary implications for depression treatments and medication, shifting reliance from medication to more natural sources such as fish oils.</p>
