                            <h2>Introduction</h2>
                            <p>With the advent of technology, programming is making waves in every field, including chemistry. The following article focuses on the link between programming languages and their applications in the field of Chemistry. It will showcase applications in areas like Computational Chemistry, Data Analysis, Studying different chemical models, molecules, etc. It will also present areas for future research as well as limitations in this field.</p>
                            <h3>Applications</h3>
                            <p>There are multiple applications in which programming languages have been a helping hand for the field of Chemistry.</p>
                            <h3>1.	Molecular Modeling </h3>
                            <p>Using coding languages like Java can help researchers and chemists better envision molecule structures of compounds such as butane by exploring 3D images and using animations to check behavioral patterns. For e.g.: The Chem-Doodle Sketcher.[1]</p>
                            <h3>2.	Computational Chemistry</h3>
                            <p>Multiple programming languages such as C++, Python, etc., have a role in computational chemistry, solving intricate chemical problems, calculating structures, and even being able to determine chemical properties such as the Cosmo salvation model for photoacidity and basicity of water.[2]</p>
                            <h3>3.	Data Analysis and Visualization </h3>
                            <p>Computer programming has been widely used in the data analysis field, even for Chemistry. It allows researchers to quickly analyze and gain information from wide datasets, helping to identify trends, behaviors, as well as readings from experiments. It has also been widely used in Chemical informatics to display 2D structures of various organic and inorganic compounds.[3]</p>
                            <h3>4.	Automation and Screening </h3>
                            <p>Researchers and experts in the field of chemistry can use MATLAB and LabVIEW type languages to view apparatus as well as make certain visualizations that would enhance their research. MATLAB allows them to classify molecules that have multiple functional groups using graph attention networks (GAT).[4]</p>
                            <h3>5.	Quantum Chemistry and Simulations</h3>
                            <p>Gaussian and NW Chemistry are used in quantum chemistry to perform various calculations along with determining molecular properties as well as observe patterns of behavior, especially odd ones.[5]</p>
                            <h3>6.	The link of Machine Learning and Chemical Informatics </h3>
                            <p>Python for ML and AI has been actively used for guessing compound chemical properties like solubility as well as toxicity and can also be used in the drug development phase.</p>
                            <h2>Challenges/Limitations</h2>
                            <p>In the vast realm of Chemistry even though, programming languages are a powerful tool, yet, within their promise lie formidable limitations. Chemists and researchers are often entrapped by the intricate web of code complexity. Thus, they struggle to utilize it. Besides that, the exorbitant costs required to maintain top-tier software for analytical models further shroud this field in financial darkness. In addition to it, the clash of compatibility also exists and hinders the ability of programming languages, as not every programming language can seamlessly permeate every scientific domain, casting a daunting shadow over progress.</p>
                            <h2>Future Research and Possibilities</h2>
                            <p>The future of this field is limitless. Many believe it can be with producing Machine Learning models. A chemist at MIT recently paired automated flow chemistry with an algorithm to predict it. The algorithm, which had learned thousands of products and reactions as well as data, was able to predict new products. The future of programming languages in chemistry can enable seeing compounds like drugs or other revolutionary materials, which can not only be recognized by Tech but also can see their molecular behavior.</p>
                            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                            <p>Thus, programming can help Chemists and researchers do their jobs more efficiently and look into molecules and structures which they couldnâ€™t have seen. With the growth of these programs, the possibilities will increase, leading to even more innovations in the field of Chemistry and other fields.</p>
