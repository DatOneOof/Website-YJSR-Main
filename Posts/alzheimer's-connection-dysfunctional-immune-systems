                        <p>There are various theories on the cure to the memory-robbing illness Alzheimer’s, but one common link currently shows particular promise- the immune system. For the last 30 years, scientists have concentrated on a protein called beta-amyloid to develop a cure for Alzheimer’s (Landhuis, 2021).</p>
                        <p>This protein is found in the fatty membranes surrounding nerve cells; it is known to be sticky and can build up into plaques. Consequently, researchers have theorized that amyloids can accumulate inside the brain, causing Alzheimer’s. Scientists have spent billions of dollars attempting to create therapies to reduce the collection of amyloids, repeatedly failing, allowing new theories to gain traction (Landhuis, 2021).</p>
                        <p>According to Knowable Magazine, researchers have previously targeted molecular pathways that regulate energy production, the flow of calcium, or the cleaning up of cellular debris. But, a new theory has begun to gain support. Earlier, Alzheimer’s research surrounding immune system dysfunction faced difficulties in finding financial support; now, this is expected to change due to discoveries.</p>
                        <p>The brain’s immune system has long been implicated as a critical factor in the development of Alzheimer’s disease, particularly a specialized type of immune cell called microglia. Microglia is a type of glial cell located throughout the brain and spinal cord that maintains homeostasis and forms myelin in the peripheral nervous system.</p>
                        <p>The microglia help to clear debris and toxic materials from the brain. However, scientists conclude that patients with Alzheimer's do not perform this function adequately and may even contribute directly to the disease process.</p>
                        <p> One theory is that the Alzheimer’s hallmark amyloid protein (clumps of misfolded proteins that accumulate in the brain, disrupting and killing neurons, resulting in progressive cognitive impairment) activates the microglia. An amyloid is a translucent substance consisting primarily of protein deposited in some organs/tissues under abnormal conditions.</p>
                        <p>The amyloid performs its function correctly at first, but when more amyloid is produced, the system becomes overwhelmed and unregulated. As large accumulations or amyloids clump together, they form deposits in the brain, triggering neurodegenerative processes that lead to memory loss and cognitive ability. Consequently, when the immune system cannot protect the body to its fullest capabilities, you are at risk for many disorders, including Alzheimer’s.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, after numerous studies analyzing the genomes of thousands of people, a common link in at-risk patient DNA variants was connected to the immune system. A study supported by the National Institute on Aging (a division of the National Institutes of Health) was conducted utilizing the electronic records of ’56 million patients, including about 1.6 million with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and other inflammatory diseases (Landhuis, 2021).</p>
                        <p>Patients taking drugs blocking ’a key molecular trigger of inflammation called the Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)’ had 50-70% lower chances of being diagnosed with Alzheimer’s compared to those prescribed drugs and did not use it (Landhuis, 2021).</p>
                        <p>TNF comes in two forms: one anchored to the membranes of cells and a soluble form that floats around in the spaces in between. The soluble TNF causes inflammation and can kill cells infected with viruses or bacteria in excess, destroying healthy tissues.</p>
                        <p>The membrane-bound form of TNF, on the other hand, confers protection against infection, to begin with (Landhuis, 2021). The drugs in use at the time inhibited both forms of TNF, leaving people at risk for infections by viruses, bacteria, and fungi that typically only cause problems for people with weakened immune systems (Landhuis, 2021).</p>
                        <p>Currently, researchers are studying an experimental drug called XPro1595 in hopes of blocking brain inflammation with increased efficiency to combat Alzheimer’s. A vital feature setting this drug apart is its ability to selectively block only one form of the TNF (Orti-Casan, 2019). This drug blocks the soluble TNF solely, stopping it from binding to a receptor and triggering inflammation.</p>
                        <p>However, the membrane-bound TNF is not blocked, allowing it to bond to a second receptor, taking on a neuroprotective role (Orti-Casan, 2019). In a study by INmune Bio, participants with excessive inflammation were treated with a TNF inhibitor once a week for 12 weeks. Findings reported that inflammation dropped 2.3% in participants who received a high dose of TNF inhibitor; MRI analysis displayed a reduction of around 40% inflammation in a particular bundle of nerve fibers called the arcuate fasciculus that is important for language processing and short-term memory (Landhuis, 2021).</p>
                        <p>According to Knowable Magazine, today, companies primarily work with the “adaptive” immune system, which attacks pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) or molecules, specifically recognizing them and marking them for destruction.</p>
                        <p>Experimental therapies include antibodies that recognize amyloid and target it for removal. In my opinion, the best way to progress in researching treatment for Alzheimer’s is to focus on the ‘adaptive immune system’ and ‘training it’ to recognize amyloids and target them for removal.</p>
