                        <h2 class="section-heading">1.0 Introduction</h2>
                        <p>A recent vast increase in disposable income and consumerism has caused marketing tactics to continuously evolve. Data has revealed that “actively engaged consumers account for more than 23% increase in a firm's average revenue, while actively disengaged consumers account for a 13% revenue drop” (Digital Service Cloud, 2013, as cited in Prentice & Loureiro, 2018). Subsequently, brands must implement a variety of marketing approaches to maintain competitive profit and brand engagement (Prentice & Loureiro, 2018). Such approaches change based on psychological trends that sweep through a variety of targeted demographics including women, youth, and Eastern society. In particular, marketing has adapted to trends such as female beautification, status declaration, or exclusivity (Ngai & Cho, 2012; Singh, 1993; Wu et al., 2015).</p>
                        <p>Previous research has studied two areas: (i) how marketing impacts psychology of different group demographics and (ii) how individual psychological responses reflect in marketing strategies (Ngai & Cho, 2012; Prentice & Loureiro, 2018; Stokburger-Sauer & Teichmann, 2013; Thani & Sharma, 2021). For instance, the marketing of luxury goods to the female demographic relations largely focused on the physical and material aspects of beautification. Thus, luxury fashion and clothing in this regard are employed as a means to enhance their perceived attractiveness (Singh, 1993). In contrast, the motivation behind luxury consumption in Eastern societies is “not to express individuality, but rather to heighten social status” (Wu et al., 2015, p. 11).</p>
                        <p>Consumers’ behaviors are often reflected in involvement with the brand through engaging with the brand community online or offline (Prentice & Loureiro, 2018). <br>Individuals desire to possess items before embracing the action to purchase them and influence others. Purchases are motivated by incentives marketed by brands. These incentives could be monetary or non-monetary rewards. An individual's desire for these rewards would influence this person to be engaged with the preferred luxury fashion brand. Whether consumers choose to engage with a brand post exposure, this marketing can either negatively or positively affect an individual, while almost always benefiting the brand. Hence, we argue that understanding the customer-based perspective can help an individual make informed decisions when engaging with a brand.</p>
                        <p>If research can clearly display the two-way flow between marketing and psychology, maximized customer benefit can coexist with an increase in firm earnings. These intricate connections between marketing and psychology are the subject of this paper. When consumers choose to engage with a brand, they reveal to marketers their personal desires and motivations for luxury good purchases. Subsequently, marketers can use the data collected (i.e. psychological responses to marketing) to target engaged audiences.</p>
                        <p>This paper examines how psychology and marketing relate to consumers’ engagement with luxury fashion brands, and how awareness of such engagement relates to the consumers’ well-being. The paper contributes to retailing literature by revealing how marketing can increase profit while simultaneously improving customer well-being. <br>Understanding this relationship has important implications for luxury brand consumers, allowing them to make more informed decisions when purchasing from luxury brands.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">2.0 Psychology and Impacts of Marketing</h2>
                        <p>The marketing of luxury consumption and brand identity can have varied effects on the mental well-being of the customers of the same. Through the means of this paper, we shall seek to explore the same in specific demographics to get a broader picture.</p>    
                        <h3>2.1 Women</h3>
                        <p>As a part of a landmark study, Stokburger-Sauer & Teichmann (2013) aimed to shed light on the role of gender as it relates to luxury goods consumption. They found out that women, on average, have a more positive attitude and increased buying intention when it comes to luxury consumption. They deduced that this might be due to the fact that men evaluate women based on their physical attractiveness, and luxury products and fashion are a method through which women can effectively enhance the same (Singh, 1993). This has caused luxury products for the female demographic to be consistently priced higher than for the male demographic (Stokburger-Sauer & Teichmann, 2013).</p>
                        <p>This proclivity for luxury consumption causes the female demographic to be an integral source of revenue for brands, causing them to especially cater to women while advertising. “Femvertising” is the use of pro-women and typically feminist appeals while advertising to women. Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu (2019) found that most luxury brands selling traditionally feminine products employ femvertising while marketing.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, advertising to women has left certain sections of the female demographic behind. Pankiw et al. (2021) found that in 1,144 separate luxury advertisements, the models employed to advertise the products to women are under age 30 (77% of the time), Caucasian (80%), highly attractive (90%) and thin (93%) The small amount of diversity (a non-white or mature model) that did exist in the advertisements typically featured established celebrities.</p>
                        <p>This in a sense is the reinforcement of the Eurocentric standards of beauty prevalent in the West. The same leaves behind the coloured, mature and those with conventional body shapes. Lee et al. (2014) found that women of color respond more positively to advertisements with other women of color due to the increased sense of familiarity and solidarity.</p>
                        <h3>2.2	The Generations</h3>
                        <p>Luxury advertising has changed a lot in recent years due to the technological progress that has made it possible to market in novel ways. This shift in advertising from traditional print media to more digital platforms has brought about shifts in the mindsets and psyches of the younger generations exposed to these mediums.</p>
                        <p>In Kamal (2013), the authors looked into the amount of social media usage, favorability to advertisements and levels of materialism in Generation-Z (late 1990s to early 2010s born) teens both the West and the East. He discovered that the amount of social media consumed (linked to the amount of advertisements one is exposed to) has a proportional impact on the subject's materialism quotient, with those with more than average social media usage displaying higher levels of using material possessions as a symbol of success. The younger generations are in essence a captive and lucrative audience for social media advertisers of luxury brands. They reinforce the notion that consumption leads to happiness in the minds of the youth.</p>
                        <p>If we are to look at Generation-Y (early 1980s to late 1990s born) individuals (popularly dubbed “Millennials”), Giovannini et al. (2015) found that Millennials are highly public self-conscious individuals that preferred to purchase brand name clothing because they were concerned with how their peers viewed them. As such, the authors noted that the most effective method of advertising to Millennials were appeals that communicate the message of popularity and respect from others. Marketing strategies that position luxury fashion brands as status symbols that support or encourage a specific lifestyle or personal value were especially persuasive.</p>
                        <p>By contrast, Generation-X (late 1960s to early 1980s born) and older individuals respond more to honest messages, with hype and exaggerated claims turning them off (Braverman, 2005). In addition, Kim & Lee (2014) found that the qualities that appealed to the older generations the most while being advertised to by luxury brands were utility, quality, and lastly prestige.</p>
                        <h3>2.3	The Eastern World</h3>
                        <p>With its fast-growing economies and huge populations, Asia is becoming a hotbed for luxury consumption, especially in recent years. The People’s Republic of China is the world’s biggest consumer of luxury goods, accounting for one quarter of total global luxury expenditure (Yousuf, 2012). In general, Asian societies share broad cultural values that set them apart from Western societies (Li et al., 2012), this is reflected in both consumption and advertising. Mianzi (prestigious face) is a unique characteristic of Asian luxury customers in terms of motivation, especially in the Sino-sphere of influence (Li & Su, 2007). Wong and Ahuvia (1998) finds that luxury consumption in the West is driven by internal motivations such as personal taste and individual preference, whereas, in the East, it is more likely to be influenced by external factors including face pressure and others' opinions in luxury consumption.</p>
                        <p>These differences have even caused luxury advertising from Western brands to be perceived differently in Asia than in the West. Chen & Wang (2017) finds that traditionally, in general, Western luxury brands have focused on low-level consumer engagement to build social media presence. Conversely, this has caused customers in Asia to “perceive Western luxury brands’ social media advertising as conservative, distant, and inactive” (p.1).</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, with the advent of globalization and a more interconnected world, Asian luxury consumption and advertising has been affected in slight ways by Western culture. Due to the hegemonic nature of Western culture and the popularity of its media, a certain Eurocentrism seems to be taking hold in the minds of people in Asia, with the younger generations being especially susceptible (Das & Jebarajakirthy, 2020). This has affected the mature luxury market in Asia as well, however, mature customers acculturate to Western culture while maintaining their own Asian culture. Eurocentrism only partially drives their intention to purchase Western fashion luxury items. Therefore, luxury advertising in Asia has sought to integrate aspects of Asian culture to not alienate their mature consumer base.</p>
                        <h4>2.3.1 Women in Asia</h4>
                        <p>Wu et al. (2015) finds that for women in Asia, the factors that make a brand a luxury brand are exclusivity, a high price and reputation. This ties into the aforementioned concept of "face" that is prevalent in Asian cultures, as women in Asia seek to reinforce their identity and establish their credibility through the consumption of luxury goods. Aspects specific to women - the desire to seek out and build social relationships within the community, also play a significant role in advertising to women in Asia. Frith (2008) discovers that the most common appeals during advertising in luxury women’s magazines remain “sex, fashion and relationships”.</p>
                        <p>Luxury advertising in Asia to women largely remains entertainment and consumption oriented, similar to the west. However, as Frith finds, Asian women’s reception of advertising messages are drastically different from that of women in the West, due to the much more rigid standards of beauty. She highlights Dove’s worldwide advertising ‘Campaign for Real Beauty’. This campaign was poorly received in China. The advertisements for the same featured realistic women with real body shapes. While it was massively popular in Western nations such as the US, Australia and Europe, Chinese women preferred images of ‘perfect’ women and disliked seeing imperfect women in the ads. Rather than seeing the ‘perfect’ models as having unattainable beauty, the Chinese women surveyed said that “these models gave them something to aspire to” (p. 14).</p>
                        <p>Mo (2021) finds that age is also a significant driver of female consumers' luxury consumption in Asia. In Confucian culture, one’s age in life is deeply associated with life goals and accomplishments at different stages. As such, an increase in age correlates with an increase in luxury consumption due to the need for the equivalent luxury goods one “should” have at a certain age. Advertising plays into this significance of aging in Asia, as it appeals to a sense of personal responsibility that a woman should have a certain luxury product (a designer bag, luxury scents, designer dresses) by a certain age. One woman interviewed during the writing of Mo (2021) said, “When I was 25 years old, I thought that I must have luxury brands such as LV and Chanel because I am going to be 30 soon” (p. 13). Consistent with the results of Mo (2021), men tend to consume luxury goods to enhance family face, whereas women are to consume luxury items to compensate for aging personal face in Asia. The advertising is consequently different for men and women in Asia.</p>
                        <h4>2.3.2 Men in Asia</h4>
                        <p>In Chen et al. (2020), the researchers discovered that for men in Asia, although price is considered to be the rawest metric for luxury, brand meanings, iconography and symbolism play a bigger role when differentiating between luxury brands and non-luxury brands. Lending itself to such notions of differentiation between luxury brands is the finding that eastern men consider luxury consumption of different brands to be an extension of their individual personalities, styles and identities.</p>
                        <p>However, advertising to eastern men does differ from advertising to eastern women. Specifically, while luxury advertising to women in Asia might focus on the content of the specific ad (Chen & Wang, 2017), advertising to men in Asia is conducted with much more subtlety and indirectness. Luxury advertising is not something that immediately motivates their purchase intentions. In fact, in some cases, direct luxury advertising is perceived to have low credibility. Rather, participants of the study described making the decision to purchase luxury goods after continuous luxury advertising on third-party social media accounts (in the form of blogs, videos, posts) sparked a desire to conduct more in-depth research into the same.</p>
                        <p>Nevertheless, luxury brands, in general, have been failing to connect with the male demographic in the eastern world. Wang (2019) highlights that the values men in Asia cherished the most with making luxury purchase decisions are quality, ingenuity, and professionalism. As such, tests conducted during Chen et al. (2020) highlight the fact that these values “were not adequately addressed in the topics of luxury brand social media advertising” (p. 15).</p>
                        <p>Additionally, given the patrilineal nature of Asian societies, males feel a much more pronounced sense of responsibility to bring honor and social credibility to their family and parents (Mo, 2021). Thus, this involves the consumption and purchase of luxury goods to display one's increase in social standing. As they bear an increased responsibility for the same, the inverse relationship between luxury consumption and the economic condition of the parents is much stronger in men than in women. Therefore, luxury advertising, as an extension of luxury consumption in general, reinforces this social pressure on men in Asia.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">3.0	Recent Psychological Influences on Marketing</h2>
                        <p>By taking into account the various reactions of their engagers, luxury marketers have the potential to increase positive benefits for consumers. Engagers are those that react to advertising, but do not necessarily purchase from a brand. Consumers are engagers who react to and purchase items. Positive benefit is defined as an effect that increases an individual’s overall well-being. Research has found that hedonic, or pleasure purchases lead to positive social wellbeing (Prentice & Loureiro, 2018). Particularly, scientists define the factors that make up this well-being as “positive consequences”. These consequences, whether material or emotional, lead customers to repeatedly buy from a particular brand (Thani & Sharma, 2021).</p>
                        <p>This section of the paper introduces examples of how companies have moved marketing practices towards integration of the customer benefit model.</p>
                        <h3>3.1	Engagers and Consumers</h3>
                        <p>Consumption of luxury goods is strongly influenced by social needs such as prestige and self-image (Zheng et al., 2013). Such social needs are driven by two competing social needs: the need for uniqueness and the need for conformity in purchase. Such behaviors either ostracize others socially by using a luxury brand as a signal of wealth or are used to avoid such ostracism (Commuri, 2009, as cited in Oneto et al., 2012). In recognizing these two needs, it has been pointed out that luxury brands target two types of consumers: elites, and the majority masses. The elites are usually more fashion conscious and would like to portray themselves as unique, while the masses seek to emulate the choices of the elites.</p>
                        <p>Marketing takes into account the social needs of both groups by appealing in different ways. For instance, the luxury brand Burberry engages its two main audiences based on the different psychological motivations behind purchase (Zheng et al., 2013). These two audiences are the leader group (who desire uniqueness) and the follower group (who attempt to emulate the leader group). Burberry holds yearly fashion shows in Milan to attract its elite customers, the leader group, establishing a sense of exclusivity and wealth. Simultaneously, Burberry is the leading fashion brand on Facebook with over one million followers. This social media presence is designed to capture the follower group, who engage based on desires to own the same looks as the leader group.</p>
                        <p>It is important to note that many recent luxury marketing strategies fall into the category of firm based outcome. In other words, advertisements are targeted to increase firm income without taking into consideration customer benefit. In the case of Burberry, buying the advertised product increases the consumer’s perception of themselves, thereby allowing the customer to achieve the greater self value and image they seek (Thani & Sharma, 2021). However, this sense of self value stems from an advertisement that utilises human desire to convince engagers to buy products.</p>
                        <h4>3.1.1 Effects of Current Marketing</h4>
                        <p>As discussed in the above sections, marketing, particularly towards gender and cultural groups, can cause a plethora of pressure and “negative” consequences. Thani and Sharma (2021) show that many luxury purchases are made because of hedonic considerations rather than for practical or conscious reasons. In other words, luxury consumers often purchase based on emotion such as enjoyment, pleasure, and desire.</p>
                        <p>Nonetheless, it is vital to note that these emotions are brief. The feelings of pleasure are comparable to that of a dopamine rush from social media likes: instant, intense, and rapid. The result is a temporary purchase reward in the form of emotional enjoyment. Further, the ownership of luxury brands frequently brings on intense desirability and a portrayed image that passes a symbolic value to others (Prentice & Loureiro, 2018). This symbolic value could be personal or professional. Hence, it can be claimed that luxury items represent status, money, or uniqueness, all of which are factors that motivate people to view the owner as wealthy or more powerful (Thani & Sharma, 2021). The regular masses (referred to above as the follower group) therefore seek to mimic the visual prestige brought about by the elite leader group. This could be through engaging with marketing on social media or physically buying a product from the brand. However, these expectations of attaining distinction and status are not always realized, which results in imposter syndrome being experienced by the individual. Imposter syndrome occurs when a purchaser of luxury items feels a sense of “fakeness rather than a sense of belonging” (p.3).</p>
                        <p>It is clear that marketing based purely on desirability and social needs only results in a temporary solution for greater well-being and status. By developing and creating relationships with individual customers, luxury companies establish a secure atmosphere where consumers experience a sense of belonging to the leader group and a better feeling about themselves (Thani & Sharma, 2021). This also allows for customers to feel valued by the brands which they interact with.</p>
                        <h4>3.1.2 A Move Towards Subjective Well-Being and Positive Consequences</h4>
                        <p>Marketing influences not only the “immediate” purchase but also the “long-term brand equity of the luxury brand” (Zheng et al., 2013, p.1). As such, a positive personal experience for customers is essential in building a long term customer base.</p>
                        <p>Customer engagement has primarily been discussed as a precursor to firm based outcome (i.e. financial gain) (Prentice & Loureiro, 2018). However, engaging with a luxury fashion brand also prompts feelings of self-content, thereby enhancing well-being (Fionda and Moore, 2009, as cited in Prentice & Loureiro, 2018). Subjective well-being refers to one's emotional reactions to “events as well as cognitive judgements of satisfaction and fulfillment” (Diener et al., 2009, p. 63, as cited in Prentice & Loureiro, 2018). It includes the experience of pleasant and exciting emotions and minimal negative feelings, all indicative of a rewarding life (Bhullar et al., 2013; Diener et al., 2009; Jalloh et al., 2014; Loureiro and Panchapakesan, 2016, as cited in Prentice & Loureiro, 2018).</p>
                        <p>In short, purchasing luxury products contributes directly to a firm's value while simultaneously creating enhanced well-being. As subjective well-being is affected by judgement about a consumer’s life and social identity, purchasing luxury brands has been proved to provide positive emotional and psychological values (Prentice & Loureiro, 2018).</p>
                        <p>As part of a move to increase customer well-being and brand equity, a new trend called “quiet luxury” has emerged (Thani & Sharma, 2021). People are attempting to flaunt wealth and status differently as environmental and social awareness increases. Subsequently, brands must be diverse to appeal to a wide range of customers. Luxury retailers are “refining their brand identities and corporate social responsibility in areas such as the environment, gender ratio or pay gap, and diversity provisions” (p. 2). For instance, Jimmy Choo, Versace, Steve Madden, and Michael Kors, use a recruiting program called Hello Hive to increase the diversity of their workforce. Other companies such as Gucci, OlsenHaus, and Stella McCartney market sustainable goods in order to reach customers who are more climate conscious (Murray-Ragg, 2020).</p>
                        <p>Marketing firms have historically focused on the ability to leverage customers for maximized profit and competitive advantage (Prentice & Loureiro, 2018). In more recent years, the above techniques have been used to demonstrate how consumers can engage with luxury brands and bring themselves happiness and subjective well-being. Customers that engage with brands who commit to environmental problems, diversity, or gender ratios not only stimulate feelings of pleasure and increased status, but also can improve their relative well-being.</p>
                        <p>As described in Thani and Sharma (2021), if businesses can direct marketing away from status or exclusivity and towards an “aspiration self”, that being an ideal self that can realistically be achieved through effort, they can maintain a large customer base through the personal and positive experience consumers have with the brand.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">4.0 Conclusions</h2>
                        <p>It is evident that the connections between marketing and psychology play a large role in how a consumer experiences luxury products. In certain cases, purchasers feel short term pleasure and status gain from owning luxury goods. This brief high point allows the consumer to feel like a more elite member of society. In contrast, the same short term emotions can also result in imposter syndrome, where a consumer does not feel they belong in the luxury brand circles, no matter how often they purchase goods. Hence, it has been shown that purchasing for the sole sake of image does not yield an entirely positive customer experience.</p>
                        <p>In addition, the unique identities, ethnicities, and ages of the individuals being advertised also plays a huge role into the psychological impact of the advertisements. Luxury marketing has in the past alienated the disenfranchised and oppressed in society, and advertisers will need to incorporate the same if they seek to break into these demographics. Luxury advertising has far-reaching consequences globally, shaping an entire generation of customers growing up around the world.</p>
                        <p>Consequently, this paper endeavored to reveal customer based marketing models and how they contribute to repeat brand engagement and overall well-being for a customer. Using models including quiet luxury or the aspiration self, luxury brands can continue to gain financially from their customer base, while providing a more personal, consistent, and meaningful experience for customers. If a consumer is actively engaged in a luxury brand’s conversation, this person must own the brand products or has a lot to do with the brand (Prentice & Loureiro, 2018). When this conversation shows the value of community, climate, diversity, and more, it is reflected positively on engagers and consumers alike. Therefore, association with the luxury brands showcases social development - working towards the well-being of society - and status distinction, both of which reinforce subjective well-being.</p>
                        <p>All in all, luxury brand customers can now understand the connections between marketing and psychology and how they can benefit best from purchasing luxury brand items.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">5.0 Limitations and Future Recommendations</h2>
                        <p>This paper only begins to research a relatively new concept in luxury marketing. Hence, the authors recognize that limitations exist. First, the examples presented are limited and do not cover the full scope of marketing tactics used in the past. Subsequently, a sufficient but not all encompassing understanding of past marketing and its impacts is present. Second, this paper only discusses social motives and impacts based upon limited examples of desire, social status, culture, and gender. To gain a greater understanding of how these parts fit together, future studies should endeavor to seek more data in order to successfully generalize at a global scale.</p>
