                        <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>Plastics' primary source of pollution is now detected in the human body and has shocked medical researchers and left them worried. These pollutants evolved into microplastic forms that created more harm to the Earth than we expected. The pollution created by us humans is now beginning to affect us.</p>
                        <p>Plastic is artificial, compostable waste, whereas microplastics are minute, 0.2-inch-diameter bits of plastic. These have poisoned the Earth, transforming it into a massive hazardous pollutant that is now designed to endanger life.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Case Study</h2>
                        <p>Researchers studied blood samples from 22 anonymous individuals and discovered that 17 of those tested, had microplastic material in their blood, which stunned them.</p>
                        <p>Microplastics were found in approximately 80% of the samples analysed by a team of Dutch researchers. This finding is significant because it demonstrates that microplastics can travel throughout the body via the bloodstream and remain in organs. The truth is that no one knows if these particles will have a long-term effect on human health.
                        <p>According to a study published in the International Journal of the Environment, half of these samples contained PET, a microplastic commonly found in beverage bottles. Polystyrene, which is often used in food packaging, was identified in 36% of the pieces. It is worth noting that this polyethylene is employed in packaging films and bags.</p>
                        <p>For the first time, researchers discovered microplastics in human lungs. The study, which was published in the Journal of Science of the Total Environment, is the first to discover plastics in living people's lungs.</p>
                        <p>According to a recent study, microplastics have also been discovered in the placenta. Six women were investigated and evaluated for microplastics using microspectroscopy. They discovered 12 microplastic particles, 5 of which were 10 micrometres in size.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">How is it harmful to Us?</h2>
                        <p>Plastic particles, according to The Independent, can enter the human body through the air, food, and beverages. According to the report, such particles can induce chronic inflammation. It has been stated that adequate house ventilation is required for humans to escape. This is because microplastic concentrations tend to be higher indoors than outdoors.</p>
                        <p>Plastic waste is dumped by man everywhere on Earth, from the mountains to the oceans. Researchers have found the presence of microplastics in water, sediment, and native animals and plants. In January last year, they discovered microplastics in fish and other seafood samples from the Sal estuary in Goa,India.</p>
                        <p>A Philippine study published in Marine Pollution Bulletin examined 120 rabbitfish purchased from local fishers in Dumaguete and Bais, as well as the towns of Manjuyod and Ayungon. It was discovered that nearly half of the fish samples tested positive for microplastics in their digestive systems.</p>
                        <p>Several theories are being discussed about how these microplastics are harmful. For instance, if they're small enough to enter cells or tissues, as reported to be found in various human body organs, they might be irritated just by the  foreign presence. Also, if it is a long, thin fibre of asbestos, it can inflame lung tissues and lead to cancer.</p>
                        <p>Microplastics, as many people suspect, operate as vectors for bacteria and harmful chemicals, creating additional health hazards. Consequently, neurotoxicity and carcinogenic impacts have been demonstrated in studies. Microplastics have also been found to serve as endocrine disruptors, interfering with normal hormone activity and potentially causing weight gain.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>More detailed research is needed on how microplastics affect the human body's processes. In particular, this problem is becoming more urgent because of the increase in plastic production.<br>The concern remains that microplastics are omnipresent. In 2015, oceanographers estimated between 15 and 51 trillion were floating about in surface waters across the globe.</p>
