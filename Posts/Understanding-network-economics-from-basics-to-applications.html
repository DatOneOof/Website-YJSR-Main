                        <p>In the near future, 5G, the fifth generation of cellular network technology, will play an increasingly important role in modern life. The modern economy would be diminished without commerce services like transportation, communications, and information. The fact that many important non-network industries have a lot of economic characteristics in common with network industries is even more intriguing.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">What’s network economics?</h2>
                        <p>An economic network is a combination of individuals, groups, or countries interacting to benefit the community as a whole by developing sustainable products and technologies. Any group's primary goal in an economic network is to strengthen its position in the market.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Why do we call it “the emerging economic order within the information society”?</h2>
                        <p>Network economy is concerned with understanding economic phenomena by using network concepts and the tools of network science. The value obtained by the creation of products and services is added through social networks operating on a global scale. This value-added is shared with all members of the society rather than sharing only with the individual enterprises.</p>
                        <p>The economics (market structure and shares, pricing, investment) of a network industry are fundamentally different depending on whether a firm can individually define and alter technical standards so that its products are compatible or incompatible with other firms. When firms can do so, there are fundamentally new and interesting features of market structure. Moreover, the decision of whether to be compatible with other firms, and to what extent, is a fundamental strategic decision of firms in these markets. In a regulated industry i.e. in many telecommunications markets, firms are required to be compatible with competitors. This is guaranteed by mandatory interconnection among all service providers which maximizes network effects, and simultaneously eliminates the possibility of choosing incompatibility. Thus, in a regulated network industry, the issues are usually confined to the special case of full compatibility. This raises the issue of which telecommunications markets to deregulate and how to shield markets from potentially anti-competitive effects.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Illustration</h2>
                        <p>We all have read that networks are composed of links that connect to nodes in a complementary manner. Consider, for instance, the Information Superhighway network (given in Fig. 1); it provides substitutes made of compliments in the same manner we purchase goods and services from a departmental store. The services demanded by us contain many complementary components and there are close substitutes for each of these components. We buy these services depending on our preferences for the complementary and substitute components.</p>

                            As far as economics is concerned, consumer goods are of two types- 
                            <ol>
                                <li>Complementary goods (that are always used together)</li>
                                <li>Substitute goods (that are used in place of one another)</li>
                            </ol>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Classification of Networks</h2>
                        <p><b>Networks are of two types:- one-way and two-way.</b> The classification of network type depends on the interpretation of the structure to represent a specific service, meaning that a network can be interpreted as either one-way or two-way depending on the feasibility.</p>
                        <div>

                        </div>
                        <p>Have a look at a simple star telephone network in Fig. 2. <br>A phone call from A to B is composed of AS (access to the switch of customer A), BS (access to the switch of customer B), and switching services at S.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>When services AB and BA are distinct &RightArrow; Two-Way Network</li>
                            <li>When services AB and BA are identical &RightArrow; One-Way Network</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><b>One-way:</b> There is no sense of direction in the network or one of the services is unfeasible. Eg:-ATMs, broadcasting, paging, and vertically related industries.</p>
                        <p><b>Two-way:</b> Two end-users exchange information with each other through a single or multiple common relays/services. Eg:- railroad, road, and many telecommunications networks.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">The Mutual Relationship between One-Way and Two-Way Networks</h2>
                        <p>According to Economides and White (1994), the relationship in both one-way and two-way networks is the complementarity between the pieces of the network as demonstrated in Fig. 3. This crucial economic relationship is also often observed between different classes of goods in non-network industries.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">What does it signify?</h2>
                        <p>The analysis of network structure is carried out under the assumption of compatibility, i.e., that various links and nodes on the network are costlessly combinable to produce demanded goods. Two complementary components A and B are compatible when they can be combined to produce a composite good or service.</p>
                        <p>Simple network goods and vertically related goods are immediately combinable because of their inherent properties. However, for many complex products, actual complementarity can be achieved only through adherence to specific technical compatibility standards. Thus, many providers of network goods make their products partially or fully incompatible with components produced by other firms.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Virtual Networks</h2>
                        <p>A virtual network can be thought of as a collection of compatible goods that share a common technical platform. Virtual networks are one-way networks. For example, all VHS video players make up a virtual network. Other examples are computer hardware and software; computer operating systems and software applications etc.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">The Network Algorithms</h2>
                        <p>Basic examples of network algorithms are:</p>
                        <p><b>The shortest path problem</b> in which one seeks to determine the most efficient path from an origin node to a destination node.</p>
                        <p><b>The maximum flow problem</b> in which one wishes to determine the maximum flow that one can send from an origin node to a destination node, given that there are capacities on the links that cannot be exceeded.</p>
                        <p><b>The minimum cost flow problem</b> where there are both costs and capacities associated with the links and one must satisfy the demands at the destination nodes, given supplies at the origin nodes, at a minimal total cost associated with shipping the flows, and subject to not exceeding the arc capacities.</p>
                        <h3>Applications of the Shortest Path Problem:</h3>
                        <ul>

                        </ul>
                        <h3>What led to economic theory to intervene in networks?</h3>
                        <p>Traditionally, networks were analyzed under the assumption that each network was owned by a single firm. There was a considerable amount of research on economies of scope, i.e., on the efficiency gains from the joint operation of complementary components of networks.</p>
                        <p>The reduced role of IBM in the ’80s and ’90s in the setting of technical standards in computer hardware and software, fragmented ownership in the telecommunications sector in the USA, and low costs of transmission have been in question since the early 20th century. These significant changes in costs and the convergence of communications services opened a number of policy questions on pricing, unbundling, deregulation, and possibly mandated segmentation in this sector leading researchers and technologists to contact economists for business models in network analysis.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">The fundamental property of networks- Network Externalities</h2>
                        <p>Network externalities or network effects are the effects a product or service has on a user while others are using the same or compatible products or services. Networks exhibit positive consumption and production externalities. A positive consumption externality signifies the fact that the value of a unit of the good increases with the number of units sold. But according to the Law of Demand, the willingness to pay for the last unit of a good decreases with the number of units sold as observed in the traditional non-network industries. Thus for Economists, <u>"the value of a unit of the good increases with the expected number of units to be sold”</u>. Thus, the demand slopes downward but shifts upward with increases in the number of units expected to be sold.</p>
                        <p>Networks may also exhibit negative network externalities that can create negative feedback and exponential decay. Eg- railroad networks.  When the efficiency of a network decreases as more people use it, congestion takes place which reduces the value to people already using it. Traffic congestion and network congestion display these features.</p>
                        <p><b>Note:-</b> In this article, our research focuses on the part of positive externalities since the negative ones are rare and beyond the scope.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Sources of Network Externalities</h2>
                        <p>The key reason for the appearance of network externalities is the complementarity between the components of a network. Depending on the network, the externality may be direct or indirect. When customers are identified with components ie in a two-way network, the externality is direct. In typical one-way networks, the externality is only indirect.</p>
                        <p>There are two ways in which these externalities arise. First, in the act of exchanging assets or goods. Secondly, in the array of vertically related services like services of a broker, bringing the offer to the floor, matching the offer, etc, that compose a financial transaction. We observe these externalities in the financial markets where the increasing size of an exchange market increases the expected utility of all participants including traders. In financial terms, higher liquidity increases traders’ utility. For instance, electronic call markets bunch transactions and execute them all at once, as discussed in the paper by Economides and Schwartz. Call markets have inherently higher liquidity because they take advantage of network externalities in exchange. Thus, transaction costs are lower in these markets.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Understanding market structures through network externalities</h2>
                        <p>There are two approaches followed namely-</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><u>Macro Model</u>- assumes the existence of network externalities and anticipates their consequences.</li>
                            <li><u>Micro Model</u>- attempts to find the root cause of the network externalities.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p><u>Reference-</u> From Fig. 4, it is clear that the willingness-to-pay curve p(n, ni e ), i = 1, 2, ..., shows the willingness to pay for a varying quantity n, given an expectation of sales n^e = ni e. Thus p(n, n) is constructed as a collection of points p(ni^e, ni^e).</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">What did Economides and Himmelberg (1995) infer from the above?</h2>
                        <p>
                            They proved that fulfilled expectations demand increases for small ‘n’ when:-
                            <ol>
                                <li>the utility of every consumer in a network of zero size is zero (for telecom)</li>
                                <div style="text-align: center; font-weight: 900">OR</div>
                                <li>there are immediate and large external benefits to network expansion for very small networks (for vertically-related)</li>
                                <div style="text-align: center; font-weight: 900">OR</div>
                                <li>there is a significant number of high willingness-to-pay consumers who are indifferent to joining a network of approximately zero size (for software)</li>
                            </ol>
                        </p>
                        <p>This suggests that the network exhibits a positive <u>critical mass</u> under perfect competition. As the technology improves, marginal cost starts decreasing ie c < c^0, network starts at a positive size number ‘n^0’ corresponding to ‘c^0’ with the optimal stable size. This brings up the multiplicity of equilibria that allows for a network to start with a small size and then expand significantly. For instance, If MC is at c < c^o and a new invention creates a new product with significant network effects, Then it can lead to sudden significant expansions of network size.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Then why was the internet subsidized by the US government for years?</h2>
                        <p>In the presence of network externalities, it is evident that perfect competition is inefficient. The marginal social benefit of network expansion is larger than the benefit that accrues to a particular firm under perfect competition. Thus, state subsidization of network industries is beneficial to society.</p>
                        <p>The subsidized Internet was aimed at promoting interaction among military research projects and who knew that the Internet would become a commercial network occurring at every stage and every place!</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">The imperfect competition models</h2>
                        <h3>1. Monopoly structure</h3>
                        <p>The monopolist has influence over the expectations of the consumers which drives it to higher production, coordination, and networking externalities. This leads us to anticipate that as the number of firms decreases, the positive network effects may increase more than the dead weight loss so that the total surplus can get maximized in a monopoly.</p>
                        <h4>Is the Total surplus actually maximized?</h4>
                        <p>Although monopolists practice strategic influence over the market, their profit-maximizing tendency toward restricted production is stronger and leads to lower production levels than perfect competition. Thus, consumers and the total surplus will be lower in monopoly than in perfect competition. Thus, <u>the existence of network externalities cannot be claimed as a reason in favor of a monopoly market structure</u>.</p>
                        <h4>Interconnection or Foreclosure by a Local Monopolist?</h4>
                        <div>
                            <img class="illus-img" src="../assets/others/understanding_network_economics_arushi5.png">
                            <p class="img-cap">Figure 5 <br><a href="http://neconomides.stern.nyu.edu/networks/94-24.pdf">AB is a bottleneck facility</a></p>
                        </div>
                        <p>Consider Fig. 5. Many telecommunications, airline networks, and railroad networks have the structure of Fig. 5. In a railroad network, there may be direct consumer demand for links AB, BC, as well as AC. In a telephone network with demand for local telephone services (AB) and for long-distance services (ABC), there is no direct demand for BC, but only the indirect demand arising from long-distance calls ABC. In many cases, one firm has a monopoly on a link that is necessary for several services (here AB), and this link is a natural monopoly. This bottleneck link is often called an essential facility.</p>
                        <p><i>Now the main point is that a monopolist can foreclose any firm by denying access to the bottleneck facility. Then why doesn’t it do so?</i></p>
                        <p>The integrated firm (monopoly here) is better off by implementing a vertical price squeeze on the opponent, and charging a significantly higher price to the opponent ( partial coverage firm)for the use of the monopolized link than it "charges" itself. Thus, foreclosure, although feasible, is not optimal for the monopolist.</p>
                        <h3>2. Oligopoly and Monopolistic Competition Under Compatibility and Incompatibility</h3>
                        <p>Every oligopolist takes the output of all others as given and sets the expectation of consumers of his own output. He supports a network of size between monopoly (M = 1) and perfect competition (M = ∞). In this case, firms produce on the downward-sloping part of the firm-scaled fulfilled expectations demand such that the costs are tangential to the demand as seen in Fig. 6.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>In case of total incompatibility, where every firm adheres to its own unique standard, firms join a larger coalition and an area of reduced competition as shown by Katz and Shapiro (1985).</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">The "Micro" Model</h2>
                        <p>The micro approach starts with an analysis of the specific micro-structure of a network. Here, we distinguish between the case where only end-to-end services are demanded (the macro model) and the case when there is also demand for some services that do not reach from end to end. Eg:- the railroad and telephone networks provide both end-to-end and partial coverage service.</p>
                        <p>Let’s assume only end-to-end services are demanded. There are two complementary types of goods A, and B, and each type of good has several brands available, Ai, i = 1, ..., m, Bj, j = 1, ..., n, as in Fig. 3. Let consumers demand 1:1 combinations AkBj. We call each of the complementary goods Ai or Bj components, while the combined good Ai Bj is called a composite good or system. Since all combinations are possible, complementary exists in potential. It is actualized when the components Ai and Bj are combinable and function together without extra cost, i.e., when they are compatible.</p>
                        <p><u>The micro model is a way too complex structure, and thus, scientists and economists prefer the macro approach while analyzing market structures and network theories.</u></p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Mix and Match: Compatibility vs. Incompatibility</h2>
                        <div>

                        </div>
                        <p>The mix-and-match approach was originated by Matutes and Regibeau (1988) to prove that demand exhibits network externalities. Fig. 7 shows the case of compatibility. When the hybrid demand ( A1B2 and A2B1) is large compared to the own-product demand (including the case where the two demands are equal at equal prices), a firm has an incentive to want compatibility and vice-versa. If a firm’s hybrids demand is large compared to its own-product demand, it prefers compatibility and if its own-product demand is larger, then incompatibility. In case of incompatibility, profits are more responsive to price making demand more elastic in the technology standard.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Network Externalities and Industry Structure</h2>
                        <p>In the presence of strong network externalities, a monopolist exclusive holder of technology may have an incentive to invite competitors and even subsidize them for higher output. This consequent increase in market output has two effects- <u>a competitive effect and a network effect</u>. The competitive effect is an expected increase in competition because of the increase in the number of firms. The network effect tends to increase the willingness to pay and the market price because of the high expected sales.</p>
                        <p>Economides (1993b), (1996a) shows that, if the network externality is strong enough, the network effect is larger than the competitive effect, making an innovator-monopolist invite more competitors for higher production. Thus, our approach deals with network effects.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">General Features of Markets with Network Effects</h2>
                        <ol>
                            <li><u>A firm can make money from either side of the network</u>. For example, a telecommunications services provider can charge subscribers when they originate calls or receive calls.</li>
                            <li><i>Adobe distributes the “Acrobat Reader” free while it makes its profits from the “Acrobat Distiller” product that allows the creation of files that can be read by the Acrobat Reader.Adobe distributes the “Acrobat Reader” free while it makes its profits from the “Acrobat Distiller” product that allows the creation of files that can be read by the Acrobat Reader.</i> This suggests that when a network consists of software clients and servers, both provided by the same firm, the firm can use the prices of the client and server software to <u>maximize the network effect by distributing the client software at marginal cost (free) and making all its profits from the server software</u>.</li>
                            <li>The <u>availability of prices on both sides of the network allows for complex pricing strategies</u> and can be used strategically to leverage a firm’s strong strategic position on one side of the network.</li>
                            <li>Firms often <u>use price discrimination to provide favorable terms to large users</u> to maximize their network effect contribution to the market. A large customer in a financial market is sometimes given a very low price to be compensated for the positive network effect it brings to the market.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Features of Markets with Network Effects Under Incompatibility and Imperfect Competition</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Standards Wars.</li>
                            <li>A key strategic decision for a firm is the extent to which it will be compatible with other firms.</li>
                            <li>A network good has a higher value because of the existence of network effects.</li>
                            <li>A firm can choose to be compatible or incompatible with its rival spending on the relative benefits of sharing its networking effects.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Standards war leading to compatibility or incompatibility?</h2>
                        <p>In making a choice on compatibility, a firm has to balance opposing incentives of higher network or competition effects. They want to differentiate their products because they want to avoid intense competition. However, standard wars can lead to inequality in market shares and profitability which aligns with incompatibility. Here, “winner-take-most” markets are the ones ( strong networking effects) where firms can choose their own technical standards. The largest share market firms have higher sales of complementary goods resulting in more value for their goods in the industry. Eg- the PC operating systems market.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Addressing the inequality in market share</h2>
                        <p>
                            Economides and Flyer (1998) made it clear that
                            <ul style="list-style-type: '&RightArrow; '">
                                <li>All firms must produce identical products</li>
                                <li>No firm can have any technical advantage in production over any other with respect to any particular platform</li>
                                <li>“Pure network goods” where there is no value to the good in the absence of network externalities.</li>
                                <li>Consumers should be differentiated in their willingness to pay for the network good</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Markets for Adapters and Add-ons- Feasible or not?</h2>
                        <p>Not enough research has been done on the economics of adapters and interfaces. One strand of the mix-and-match literature assumes that compatibility introduced by one firm cannot be corrected by the other, so adapters are unfeasible. Economides (1991) assumes that adapters are provided by a competitive industry at cost, but decisions of the firms determine the extent of incompatibility, and therefore the cost of the adapters. Farrell and Saloner (1992) assume that converters make the technologies only partially compatible, in the sense that hybrid goods that utilize incompatible components, as well as an adapter, give lower utility than a system composed of fully compatible components. In this framework, the availability of converters can reduce social welfare, since, in the presence of converters, some consumers would buy the converter and the "inferior" technology rather than the "best" technology, although the "best" technology gives more externalities.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Applications of Network Theory</h2>
                        <p><i>Network economics is applied in various sectors whether education, biology, computer science, or even finance. Let's have a look at today’s application topology.</i></p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Game theory</li>
                            <li>Percolation theory for complex network issues</li>
                            <li>Financial Markets</li>
                            <li>Labor Markets</li>
                            <li>Peer Interactions</li>
                            <li>Security analysis in Telecommunications</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion- Network theory and scope of future research</h2>
                        <p>One of the most crucial issues that remain largely unresolved is the joint determination of an equilibrium market structure (including the degree of vertical integration) together with the degree of compatibility across firms. The extent of standardization in markets with more than two participants and the structure of "standards" coalitions also remain open questions. Markets for adapters and add-ons and issues of predation and foreclosure in networks have not been sufficiently analyzed. An analysis of the market structure in multi-period dynamic games with network externalities is also unavailable. On a more fundamental level, there is no good prediction yet of the "breakpoints" that define the complementary components in a modular design structure. Nevertheless, it is exactly this kind of modeling that is needed for the analysis and evaluation of the potential structures of the "information superhighway" network we examined before.</p>
                        <p>The evolution of economics in the telecommunications industry is the most important area of research that would be revolutionizing the future.</p>
