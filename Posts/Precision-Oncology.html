            <h2 class="section-heading">What is Targeted Therapy?</h2>
            <p>
              Targeted therapy or molecularly targeted therapy is a foundation
              of precision medicine and a type of cancer treatment that attacks,
              weakens, and destroys the proteins in charge of the irregular
              growth, division, and spread of cancerous cells. For cancer
              patients to be treated with targeted therapy, they must be
              eligible first. Patient eligibility is decided through certain
              abnormalities in their tumors which can be determined through
              biomarker testing (also known as genetic testing or molecular
              testing). Biomarker tests examine the nitrogenous base sequence of
              the tumor's DNA. This is done by obtaining a small amount of
              tissue from the tumor (This is also known as a biopsy. Normally
              performed by surgeons, radiologists, and cardiologists, biopsies
              extract a piece of the tumor's tissue to examine under a
              microscope). These changes in the tumor's nitrogenous base
              sequence can be point mutations such as addition, deletion, or the
              rearrangement of nucleotides in the tumor's DNA. In addition to
              DNA, biomarker testing also examines your tumor's RNA (ribonucleic
              acid is a type of nucleic acid present in every living organism.
              Its primary function is carrying instructions from DNA to control
              protein synthesis. It possesses a similar structure to DNA but it
              is only single-stranded rather than being a double helix and also
              possesses a higher molecular weight. DNA and RNA both possess the
              nitrogenous bases of cytosine, adenine, and guanine. However,
              instead of thymine, RNA has uracil which bonds with adenine)
              levels, RNA, and DNA tests to examine for gene fusion (Gene fusion
              is the formation of a third gene by the joining of parts from two
              different genes. This can also occur within proteins. Some
              proteins resulting from protein fusions can lead to the
              development of cancerous cells). The patient's sample is then sent
              to a lab. Thanks to biomarker tests, healthcare providers can
              obtain an accurate profile of the patient's tumor. Once the
              patient tests positive for the biomarker test, they are eligible
              for targeted therapy. There are two types of targeted therapy:
              monoclonal antibodies and small-molecule drugs. Monoclonal
              antibodies are synthetically-made antibodies engineered in labs.
              They excel in mimicking the behavior of antibodies naturally
              produced by the immune system. They essentially substitute
              antibodies by boosting your immune system and identify and attack
              infectious agents, such as cancerous cells. Monoclonal antibodies
              function in nine different ways.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                1. Marking Cancer Cells:
                <p>
                  Some monoclonal antibodies help the patient's immune system
                  recognize and attack cancerous cells by flagging them.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                2. Induction Of Cell Membrane Destruction:
                <p>
                  Certain monoclonal antibodies stimulate the patient's immune
                  system into attacking and destroying the cancerous cells'
                  cellular membrane.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                3. The Blockage Of Cell Growth:
                <p>
                  Some monoclonal antibodies inhibit the signals exchanged
                  between cancerous cells and the proteins that provide
                  instructions for their irregular growth, division, and spread.
                  Eliminating the exchange of these instructions is crucial in
                  cancer treatment as this is one of the root causes of cancer
                  development.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                4. Inhibiting Access To Blood Vessels:
                <p>
                  Cancerous tumors require a blood supply for their growth and
                  survival. Therefore, certain monoclonal antibodies block the
                  tumor's access to the body's blood vessels.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                5. Blocking Immune System Checkpoints:
                <p>
                  The immune checkpoint process occurs when a protein located on
                  the surface of immune system cells (known as T cells) binds
                  with its partner protein on the surface of another cell. This
                  can be cancer cells in tumors. When the protein on the T cell
                  binds with the partner protein, this results in an "off"
                  signal which is sent to the T cell. The goal of immune
                  checkpoints is to prevent aggressive immune responses that can
                  destroy healthy cells. However, when this occurs between a T
                  cell and a cancerous cell, the immune checkpoints prevent T
                  cells from killing cancer cells. In this case, the monoclonal
                  antibodies prohibit the T cells' protein to bind with its
                  partner protein, preventing the "off" signal from being sent
                  to the T cell. Therefore, allowing the immune cell to kill the
                  cancerous cell.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                6. Attacking Cancer Cells:
                <p>
                  Certain monoclonal antibodies directly kill cancer cells for
                  the immune system.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                7. Radiotherapy Transport:
                <p>
                  Monoclonal antibodies can bind to cancer cells. Therefore,
                  they are an excellent transport for radioactive particles.
                  They can directly deliver the radioactive treatment to the
                  cancer cell without causing further damage to healthy cells.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                8. Chemotherapy Transport:
                <p>
                  Similar to radiation therapy transport, monoclonal antibodies
                  can deliver chemotherapy drugs to cancerous cells by binding
                  with them. This way, healthy cells are not damaged.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                9. Fusion Of Cancer Cells And Immune Cells:
                <p>
                  Some targeted therapy drugs possess a combination of two
                  monoclonal antibodies. One binds to the cancerous cell while
                  the other binds to an immune cell. This connection stimulates
                  the immune cell to attack the cancer cell.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <ul>

                1. Trastuzumab (Commercial Name: Herceptin):
                <p>
                  1.A type of monoclonal antibody drug used to target cancerous
                  tumors with a high concentration of HER2 in patients with
                  breast cancer, stomach cancer, and esophageal cancer. HER2
                  (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) is a protein that
                  maintains cell growth. High levels of HER2 allow cancer cells
                  to grow and spread at a rapid rate. Patients who have a high
                  concentration of the HER2 protein in their tumors are
                  HER2-positive. The concentration of HER2 rises out of the
                  normal level when a mutation occurs in the HER2 gene that
                  causes it to make multiple copies of itself. Trastuzumab works
                  by binding itself to HER2 proteins and preventing the
                  irregular growth and spread of cancer cells.

                <p>
                  A type of monoclonal antibody drug that binds itself to the
                  vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF is a type of
                  protein produced by cells to induce the formation of new blood
                  vessels. It is a big factor in the process of angiogenesis
                  (the process of forming new blood vessels). As mentioned
                  previously, tumors need access to blood for nutriments and to
                  survive. The VEGF protein stimulates angiogenesis, allowing
                  the tumor to access blood vessels. By binding to the VEGF
                  proteins, the Bevacizumab is prohibiting the tumor to feed
                  itself. Treatments, like Bevacizumab, that interfere with the
                  production of blood vessels are called anti-angiogenesis
                  treatments.

                <p>
                  A type of monoclonal antibody drug that binds itself to CD20
                  protein (located on the B lymphocytes which is a type of white
                  blood cell). The CD20 protein is also located in cancerous
                  cells. Note that regardless of whether the cell is healthy
                  (and mature) or cancerous, the CD20 protein is found on both
                  cells. Therefore, once the rituximab is attached to the
                  protein, it helps the immune system destroy the cell or
                  destroy it on its own.

                  Similar to Trastuzumab, this drug also binds to the epidermal
                  growth factor receptor and regulates the irregular growth of
                  cancerous cells.

              The second type of Target Therapy treatment is small-molecule
              drugs. These drugs are small in size and are used to target
              molecules such as proteins that are found inside the cell. The
              first type of small-molecule drug is tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
              Tyrosine kinases are enzymes that regulate growth, motility (the
              movement of food through the entire digestive system), and many
              other elemental functions of the cell. They are often described as
              the "on'' and "off" switches of the cell. Though the tyrosine
              kinase enzyme has many functions, when studying targeted therapy,
              we are interested in the target that causes the abnormal growth,
              division, and spread of cancer cells. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors
              drugs prevent the tyrosine kinase enzyme from sending signals that
              induce the growth of cancerous cells. The drug Imatinib
              (Commercial Name: Gleevec) targets tyrosine kinase enzymes while
              the Gefitinib (Commercial Name: Iressa) drug targets the tyrosine
              kinase part of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
              protein. This is a protein that controls cell division and growth.
              Both drugs are tyrosine kinase inhibitors that control the
              irregular growth of cancer cells. The second type of
              small-molecule drug is proteasome inhibitors. These drugs prevent
              the production of the proteasome protein. The proteasome protein
              is responsible for the decomposition of intracellular proteins
              that are no longer needed. This allows the cell to reuse them to
              make other proteins. Proteasome inhibitor drugs block the
              proteasome protein and do not allow it to degrade unnecessary
              proteins. This causes unnecessary proteins to build up in the
              cancer cells which kills them.

            <h2 class="sub-heading">Application Of Targeted Therapy:</h2>
            <p>
              Targeted therapy can be used to treat non-small cell lung cancer
              which is a type of lung cancer. The first type of targeted therapy
              treatment for lung cancer is ALK targeted therapy. ALK is an
              acronym for the anaplastic lymphoma kinase, one of the many
              proteins involved in cellular growth and division that is
              controlled by the ALK gene. A minority of non-small cell lung
              cancer cases have a mutation in the ALK gene which produces the
              uncontrolled growth and spread of cancerous cells. Note that
              cancer cells that have the ALK mutation are ALK-positive cases.
              Targeted therapy drugs target the ALK mutation in cancer cells and
              shrink the size of the tumor by controlling cell growth. Some
              examples of ALK inhibitor drugs are Crizotinib (Xalkori),
              Ceritinib (Zykadia), Alectinib (Alecensaro), and Brigatinib
              (Alunbrig). The second type of targeted therapy treatment for lung
              cancer is ROS1 inhibitors. ROS1 (c-ros oncogene 1)is a gene that
              produces a protein involved in the transmission of signals in
              cells and growth. When a ROS1 gene is fused with another gene,
              this triggers a part of the ROS1 gene in such a way that it
              produces uncontrollable cell growth. The drugs Crizotinib and
              Entrectinib (Rozlytrek) are given to patients with the ROS1
              malfunction. The third targeted therapy treatment for lung cancer
              is BRAF inhibitors. BRAF ((v-RAF murine sarcoma viral oncogene
              homolog B1) is another type of protein that regulates cellular
              growth. When there is a mutation in the BRAF gene (gene BRAF
              V600E), cellular growth and division are very aggressive and cells
              do not receive instructions for when to stop. This leads to the
              development of a tumor. Dabrafenib (Tafinlar) and Trametinib
              (Mekinist) are types of BRAF inhibitor drugs that are given to
              lung cancer patients. The last targeted therapy treatment for lung
              cancer is Neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (NTKR) inhibitors.
              NTKR is a gene that produces a protein to maintain certain
              functions of neurons such as information transmission, pain
              sensory, temperature regulation and touch sensory. Similar to the
              ROS1 mutation, when the NTKR gene is fused with another gene, this
              may activate a part of a gene in a way that induces uncontrollable
              cellular growth.
            </p>
            <p>
              The biggest advantage of target therapy is the ability to treat
              cancer cells without causing further damage to healthy cells,
              something treatments like chemotherapy lack. It is also an
              excellent method for regulating cellular growth, which is a root
              problem of cancer. Lastly, target therapy also helps boost the
              immune system’s strength or even directly kills cancer cells. The
              biggest disadvantage of targeted therapy is the inability to react
              to the resistance of cancer cells. Note that targeted therapy
              treatment targets something, whether it is a protein or a gene,
              that the cancer cells need to function. It does not directly kill
              the cancer cell but destroys a fundamental tool that the cancer
              cell needs to survive. This is an important concept to understand
              when studying targeted therapy. During the treatment, the target
              of the drug (located on the cancer cell) can change while the drug
              does modify itself to adapt to that change. This does not allow
              the treatment to interact with the target. Also, it is observed
              that cancer cells often find new ways to grow and spread without
              the use of the treatment's target. All of these factors can make
              targeted therapy ineffective. Therefore, a possible solution is to
              pair another type of treatment, such as chemotherapy or
              radiotherapy, with targeted therapy. This ensures the
              effectiveness of the treatment.
