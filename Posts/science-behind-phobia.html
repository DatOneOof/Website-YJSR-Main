                        <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>A phobia is an extreme fear of something specific, which you cannot explain such as the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A person or type of person</li>
                            <li>An animal or insect</li>
                            <li>An object</li>
                            <li>A place or type of place</li>
                            <li>A situation</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>A research paper on “Specific phobias” indicates that the lifetime prevalence of specific phobias around the world ranges from 3% to 15%, When a person has a phobia, they often shape their lives to avoid what they consider to be dangerous. The imagined threat is greater than any actual threat posed by the cause of fear.</p>
                        <p>The difference between a “normal” fear and a phobia is the amount of anxiety involved, and the length of time that a high level of anxiety persists. A person with a phobia has a high level of anxiety and panic compared to a person with no anxiety disorders or phobia.</p>
                        <p><b>A phobia can be classified into 3 groups-</b></p>
                        <p>Social Phobia-Fear of being in a public place or gathering, people with this phobia fear being judged and humiliated in front of people, it is also known as social anxiety.</p>
                        <p>Specific Phobia-A specific phobia is a phobia in which specific things trigger your fear, for example, arachnophobia- The fear of Spiders, People with arachnophobia get intense anxiety and fear when they see a spider or even think about it.</p>
                        <p>Agoraphobia-The fear of being in a situation that may cause the person to feel extreme anxiety, panic, and fear.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Cause</h2>
                        <p><b>Much is still unknown about the actual cause of specific phobias. Causes may include:</b></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Traumatic Experiences- Phobias usually develop due to childhood traumatic and negative experiences, Stressful situations affect a person’s mind in different ways which can develop into phobias over the years. For example, if a child experiences severe turbulence in a flight he/she may develop Pteromerhanophobia or the fear of flying</li>
                            <li>Genetics and environment. There may be a link between your specific phobia and the phobia or anxiety of your parents — this could be due to inherited traits. Experience is also a known causing agent of phobias, for example, the way a child sees his/her parents cope with stress, anxiety, etc may affect how they cope with these kinds of emotions in later life.</li>
                            <li>Long term stress. Long term stress can cause emotions and feelings of fear, panic, depression, anxiety and over a long period could develop into a phobia or anxiety disorder</li>

                        </ul>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Reaction</h2>
                        <p><b>Some common reactions of phobias when faced with the source of terror are-</b></p>
                        <p>Physical-Rapid heartbeat/tachycardia, sweating, difficulty in breathing, avoidance of contact with the object, headache</p>
                        <p>The emotional-intense feeling of anxiety and fear, worsening of anxiety when the object comes near you. Difficulty in functioning normally because of your fear, nausea, dizziness, feeling of powerlessness, and panic.</p>
                        <p>Brain Activity-Researches show that when phobia inducing stimuli is exposed , there is an increase in activity of amyglada which reacts in response to negative emotion , which happens in case of phobias.When the phobia inducing stimuli was kept for longer periods it showed that  more parts of brain start getting activated.Which shows that facing the phobia inducing stimuli for longer periods does not reduce brain activity rather it increases it.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Common Phobia</h2>
                        <p><b>Social phobias</b></p>
                        <p>Social phobias are the most common type of fear.
                            They are considered an anxiety disorder and include excessive self-consciousness in social situations.
                            These are really hard to diagnose and sometimes are misdiagnosed as a lack of self-confidence or shyness.
                            </p>
                        <p><b>Agoraphobia: fear of open spaces</b></p>
                        <p>While it is generally understood to be a fear of open spaces, agoraphobia is a much more complex fear.
                            It is a serious anxiety disorder that makes people stay in their homes and makes living normal life really hard.</p>
                        <p><b>Acrophobia: fear of heights</b></p>
                        <p>People with Acrophobia get nauseous and vertigo when they are high above the ground, Vertigo is the sense of dizziness and nausea that people can develop.</p>
                        <p><b>Pteromerhanophobia: fear of flying</b></p>
                        <p>many people fear flying which can be caused due to a lot of triggering factors like being in a plane crash, facing severe turbulence. People with this phobia consider flying transportation with a high risk of death</p>
                        <p><b>Claustrophobia: fear of enclosed and small places</b></p>
                        <p>People with this fear are scared of enclosed spaces this phobia usually develops due to a traumatic experience faced in childhood or adult life.</p>
                        <p><b>Entomophobia: fear of insects</b></p>
                        <p>people with Entomophobia know that insects pose no threat but still feel anxious and fear when they see them, another related phobia is arachnophobia or fear of spiders which is common all around the world.</p>
                        <p><b>Ophidiophobia: fear of snakes</b></p>
                        <p>A fear of snakes is common to many and a person with this phobia experiences extreme anxiety and fear when faced with snakes.</p>
                        <p><b>Cynophobia: fear of dogs</b></p>
                        <p>A fear of dogs is a common phobia. The fear can be exacerbated by a negative experience with an animal and can be one of the most difficult phobias to conquer.</p>
                        <p><b>Trypanophobia: fear of needles</b></p>
                        <p>Trypanophobia is an extreme fear of medical procedures involving injections or hypodermic needles.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Risk factors</h2>
                        <p>Age-Usually phobias develop in childhood and rarely in adult life, research suggests that phobias are built by the experiences faced by a person in their childhood.</p>
                        <p>Family-According to research if your relative has an anxiety disorder you are most likely to develop it too, phobias could be an inherited tendency or children can just develop it by observing the way their family copes up in a stressful or negative situation.</p>
                        <p>Negative experiences-Being in a traumatic situation can develop phobias or just hearing about them can lead to the development of specific phobias.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Complications</h2>
                        <p>Social Isolation-Phobias can cause avoidance of certain things which can start work, relationships, or family problems.</p>
                        <p>Suicide-Some people with specific phobias are suicidal and depressed.</p>
                        <p>overall ,living with phobias leads to low quality of social and emotional life,which puts more stress and pressure and makes living normally really hard.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Treatments</h2>
                        <p><b>Some common treatments include the following-</b></p>
                        <p>Antidepressants-Taking an antidepressant can lift the mood and decrease the anxiety levels of a person with phobia. Antidepressants contain serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which include drugs such as Prozac, Zoloft, and Paxil, they act on neurotransmitters and help elevate the mood.</p>
                        <p>Beta Blockers-They are medications that reduce blood pressure, they can help control some physical reactions of phobias. They work by widening the artery and increasing blood flow. A common medication that a doctor may prescribe for a specific phobia is Inderal or propranolol.</p>
                        <p>Desensitization or Exposure therapy -is a method of treatment for anxiety disorders and phobias. It includes talking about the fear and phobic stimulus, exposing the patient to phobic stimulus slowly, and then calming them down while doing the same. This makes the patient get accustomed to the fear while maintaining calmness. This method of learning is also known as counterconditioning. For example, a person with Ophidiophobia or fear of snakes would be told to read about snakes, Talk about snakes, See snakes and then finally hold a snake.</p>
                        <p>Cognitive Behavioural Therapy-This treatment includes the doctor helping the patient control their reaction in different ways and cope with the phobic stimulus. It involves gradually exposing the phobias and finding ways to cope with them in different forms with the help of the therapist.</p>
                        <p>All these treatments have their own set of side effects and must be taken only when it is prescribed by a doctor or medical professional.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>Phobias can be hard and complicated to live with but it is treatable ,with the right treatment it can help people cope with their fear and live a normal and stress-free life. More research is needed in this field to understand it completely. If you have a phobia you should seek help from a medical professional.</p>
