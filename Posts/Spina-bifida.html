                        <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>Spina bifida is one of the most commonly occurring inborn disorders. The words literally mean "split spine" in Latin. If a baby has the condition during development, the neural tube doesn't close all the way, so the backbone that protects the spine doesn't form completely. It's important to know that the condition varies widely in degrees and symptoms of spina bifida vary from person to person, depending on the type and level of involvement. <br>The major cause of this disorder is a combination of genetics and environmental factors that is thought to be the main cause.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Types</h2>
                        <p>
                            There are mainly three types of spina bifida:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Spina bifida occultation</li>
                                <li>Meningocele</li>
                                <li>Myelomeningocele</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Causes</h2>
                        <p>Doctors aren't certain what causes spina bifida. It's thought to result from a combination of genetic, nutritional and environmental risk factors, such as a family history or lack of folic acid in the mother’s body. Folic acid is used for preventing and treating low blood levels of folate and high blood levels of homocysteine. People who are pregnant or might become pregnant take folic acid to prevent serious birth defects such as spina bifida.</p>
                        <p>We know that the condition is more common among white and Hispanic babies and in girls. Surprisingly, the correlation between this condition and ethnic factors has shown that white and Hispanic babies are more common in girls. Also, women who have diabetes that isn’t managed well or who are obese may be more likely to conceive children with spina bifida.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Symptoms</h2>
                        <p>
                            With spina bifida occulta, the most obvious sign may be a tuft of hair or a birthmark at the site of the defect. In the case of meningocele, there may be a thin layer of skin over the sac. With myelomeningocele there's usually no skin covering, and the spinal cord tissue is out and open. The symptoms depend on where the problem is in the spine and which spinal nerves are involved. Examples of other associated symptoms are:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Weak leg muscles</li>
                                <li>Unusually shaped feet</li>
                                <li>Uneven hips</li>
                                <li>A curved spine</li>
                                <li>Seizures</li>
                                <li>Bowel or bladder problems</li>
                                <li>Difficulty breathing, swallowing, or moving the upper arms, especially in children</li>
                                <li>Possibilities of being overweight, especially in children</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Treatment</h2>
                        <p>As it involves nerve damage, more serious types of spina bifida cannot be cured. Children with more severe cases of it need to learn mobility skills and be trained to manage their bowel and bladder functions. Some may require catheterization to permit the passage of urine. These children also require multiple surgeries as they grow up and will need assistive devices such as braces, crutches and wheelchairs throughout their lives. Surgery, physiotherapy and medication are used to treat some of the effects of spina bifida and may be needed throughout a patient's life to prevent and manage certain complications. Children with spina bifida, especially those who experienced hydrocephalus, sometimes have learning problems. These learning disorders generally involve difficulty with paying attention, expressing or understanding language, and comprehending math and reading.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>Types of spina bifida range from mild to severe. Some people may not feel any effects at all, while others may be limited in movement and learning development. It all depends on the individual case and the medical situation that was present at birth. There is help available for all children affected by spina bifida and with the affected by spina bifida and with the right care, most can lead active lives.</p>
