                        <p>Stem cell research uses cells to regenerate damaged tissues and organs. Most commonly, researchers and doctors use embryonic stem cells. due to their pluripotency (ability to develop into different cells), which begs the question of the ethics of stem cell research. However, stem cell research is advancing; the practice involves more voluntary work and the use of other stem cells in the body. Opponents of stem cell research argue that the practice destroys human life. Stem cell research serves as an important step for medical advancements because it serves as the treatment for a wide range of diseases, tests new drugs, and can come from different sources, yet many others argue that stem cell research is unethical.</p>
                        <p>Stem cell research helps with treatment for different diseases and disorders. Stem cells have the potential to regenerate damaged tissues. Embryonic stem cells, known for their pluripotent capabilities, have the ability to differentiate into various types of cells <sup>[1]</sup>. With its pluripotent capabilities, it can develop into different types of cells that help damaged tissues to promote better health. This ability self-renews damaged tissue, such as through tissue transplants. In other procedures, like graft tissue procedures, the transplanted organ needs to regenerate its cells to fit the new body's environment. Stem cell therapy facilitates tissue transplants, ensuring genetic compatibility with the patient's tissue <sup>[1]</sup>. This process would help advance different organ transplants when modified stem cells are compatible with the patient’s immune system, preventing rejection. Not only can stem cell tissues help with organ tissues, but also aids specialized cells, namely neurons. Additionally, stem cells aid in the regeneration of specialized cells, such as neurons, improving survival rates <sup>[2]</sup>. The pluripotent nature of embryonic stem cells means that they differentiate more efficiently into cells of a neural lineage than other cell types as compared to adult stem cells. Although stem cells have good qualities, due to ethical issues, it proves hard to promote the value of stem cell research. Promoting stem cell research helps discover more treatments for diseases and disorders in the future. Stem cell research holds the potential to cure many currently incurable medical conditions and contributes to the development of treatments that traditional drugs cannot provide <sup>[2]</sup>. Despite opposition, groundbreaking advancements in science rescued many people from debilitating diseases provided by stem cell research. Stem cells are used widely in the medical field, aiding in the development of treatments for various diseases that many drugs cannot provide the treatment for.</p>
                        <p>Stem cells prove very useful for drug development and developmental studies. Stem cells deliver safer alternatives to many treatments. Stem cells revolutionized medicine as the process “develop<sup>[s]</sup> therapies that minimize human suffering” <sup>[3]</sup>. Extensive research surrounding stem cells provides treatments to incurable diseases with their potential to develop into tissues that usually cannot be repaired. Stem cells allow scientists to evaluate the response of various cell types, such as heart, liver, or kidney cells, to different drugs <sup>[1]</sup>. Safety studies on validated human cells might help avoid unexpected drug toxicities and adverse effects that come along with producing new drugs. Using stem cells can also eliminate the need to test on animals. By utilizing human stem cells, researchers can avoid the inconsistencies that arise from testing on animals, resulting in more accurate assessments of drug efficacy and toxicity <sup>[1]</sup>. Animals often respond differently to the chemicals exposed during the clinical phase of drug testing, leading to inaccurate estimates of the drug’s use. The application of stem cells helps screen potential new drugs while reducing the numbers of animals required for drug testing. Many seem concerned about the ethical aspects of stem cell research, but stem cells provide a better alternative to violating animals’ rights. Stem cells also offer the possibility of developing recombinant drugs, eliminating immune responses and facilitating the development of therapeutic protein substitutes <sup>[3]</sup>. No major barriers remain in the development of new therapeutic protein substitutes due to how readily the body accepts the substances. The potential of stem cells may become the most powerful tool in medicine.</p>
                        <p>Stem cells are easily gathered from different tissues and obtained in different ways. Contrary to popular belief, most stem cells obtained for research are not embryos that have the potential to develop into humans. The cells used in the research and therapy “have lost the ability to develop into trophoblast cells” <sup>[1]</sup>. Many possess the false belief that stem cell research and therapy only uses embryonic stem cells when in reality, scientists take stem cells from adult tissues, such as fat. Stem cells are not only obtained from embryos. Outside of embryonic stem cells, bone marrow stem cells “have for decades been used to regenerate marrow tissue” <sup>[3]</sup>. Stem cells can be sourced from various tissues, including adult tissues such as fat, bone marrow, and umbilical cord blood, making them readily accessible for medical treatments. While embryonic stem cells are still used in research, advancements in technology have allowed the generation of potentially totipotent stem cells from unfertilized, non-embryogenic eggs <sup>[2]</sup>. A lot of people believe that stem cell research should not be pursued due to its use of embryonic stem cells, which they believe can develop into a human being. Although, advancements in technology fertilize the egg without compromising life, such as how other animals reproduce. Researchers and scientists retrieve stem cells from volunteers, although state laws prohibit researchers from compensating women who donate their eggs for research. Harvard researchers “had spent over $100,000 attempting to recruit women willing to donate eggs” <sup>[4]</sup>. Many of those who donate for research are volunteers who chose to do so, even without compensation proving the willingness of how they obtain the cells for research, contrary to the belief that many get coerced to do so. To conclude, stem cells exist and are obtained in many different parts of the human body.</p>
                        <p>Many argue about the immorality of the practice of obtaining stem cells. Critics believe that stem cell research is unethical because it involves destroying embryos in its early stages. Critics contend that embryonic stem cells should not be treated as disposable tissue for research purposes <sup>[5]</sup>. The question of when human life begins, conception or birth, has been highly controversial and closely linked to debates over abortion. This debate leads to the belief that embryonic stem cells can develop into life, and using them for research strips them off of the possibility of growing as a human being. Many also hold the false belief of how the process of obtaining stem cells may cause a risk to female donors who consented to research. Many people also form their beliefs according to the world around them, and due to negative media attention surrounding embryonic stem cell research, people form opinions based on that negativity. Negative media attention and misinformation contribute to biased perceptions of stem cell research, hindering its funding and public support <sup>[6]</sup>. The lack of funding leads to almost non-existent promotion for stem cell research as a whole, leading the public to form their own opinions on the topic rather than researchers proving its effectiveness and harmlessness. Religious beliefs also shape individuals' opinions on stem cell research, with some viewing it as an assault on innocent human life <sup>[5]</sup>. Many depend on religion to form their moral behavior and with the Pope saying a statement against stem cell research, leads the majority of Catholics to go against the practice. Many do not hold strong opinions of the research practice itself, but other aspects of the research. Compensation restrictions on egg donors, while intended to protect against exploitation, may inadvertently hinder the progress of research <sup>[4]</sup>. Due to the prohibition on laws compensating those who voluntarily donate for stem cell research, many worry it provides a risk of coercion. Many form their opinions based on religion, moral values, and media attention leading to a lack of funding and positive media attention for stem cell research.</p>
                        <p>Stem cell research beneficially contributes to society because they serve as the treatment for a wide range of diseases, test new drugs, and can come from different sources. Critics continuously criticize the practice of obtaining stem cells as immoral. Without the knowledge and research that stem cell research provides, developing different treatments would prove next to impossible. Stem cell research will help advance the future of medicine with researchers observing the cells. Despite stem cells' useful abilities, critics will continue to question the ethics of the process.</p>
