                        <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>Liver regeneration, or compensatory hyperplasia as it is scientifically called, is a complex-sounding but methodical process. As the topic remains largely unnoticed due to the lack of comprehensible resources, many myths obscure the steps to which liver regeneration follows. However, in reading just a little bit of research, there emerge two pathways through which liver regeneration is funneled (a cytokine-dependent and a cytokine-independent) and three steps by which the process of liver regeneration unfolds (the priming stage, the proliferation stage, and the termination stage). Despite liver regeneration’s methodical process, much of its inner workings remain unknown and complex to beginners. Understanding the intricate processes of such a content-heavy subject requires detailed knowledge of many proteins, microbiological pathways, cells, and receptors. Thus, dissecting the basic foundations of liver regeneration is crucial to renewing and gathering interest in the field. In this article, we will be focusing on the first liver regeneration pathway and its subsequent three stages.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Liver Regeneration as a Type of Compensatory Hyperplasia: the Priming Stage</h2>
                        <p>Compensatory hyperplasia, in actuality, is the proliferation or rapid replication of cells through which the size and function of the object remain unchanged. Liver regeneration is one of the most famous types of compensatory hyperplasia because the process is so rare in human organs. In the case of liver damage through partial hepatectomy (the removal of a liver’s lobes through surgery), liver regeneration follows the cytosine-dependent pathway and breaks down into three steps that take place in hepatocytes: the priming or initiation stage, the proliferation stage, and the termination stage. When the present numbers of hepatocytes are low due to liver damage, oval cells act as hepatocytes and go through the three stages instead. These hepatocyte replacements have oval nuclei and specifically appear in the liver when hepatocyte replication is inhibited in some way.</p>
                        <p>The priming stage initiates 0-5 hours after damage has been detected in the liver. Within this stage, the immediate action begins when lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from the gut travel to the liver through the shared portal blood supply, along with other proteins such as insulin from the pancreas and norepinephrine from the adrenal glands. This culmination of proteins tells Kupffer cells to begin producing tumor necrosis factor (TNF-&alpha;) and interleukin (IL-6) to help DNA synthesis. Kupffer cells are macrophages within the liver and are the first to act in a bacterial infection of the liver. TNF-&alpha; and IL-6 are the most-widely studied cytosines, whose role as small proteins and cell signalers is to interact with cellular receptors and function as common inflammation regulators and immune responders. Therefore, this pathway is known as the cytosine-dependent pathway.</p>
                        <p>True to their function as cell signalers, TNF-&alpha; and IL-6 signal originally-quiescent hepatocytes (the major living tissue cell that can divide when needed, otherwise known as parenchymal cells) to bypass the G0 stage and enter the G1 stage of the cell cycle. During this process, transforming growth factor &beta; (TGF&beta;), which inhibits hepatocytes from replicating, is blocked.</p>
                        <p>In case studies conducted on rats, DNA synthesis starts after 12 hours instead of 0-5 and hepatocyte replication reaches the S phase of the cell cycle during the 24th hour. In situations where hepatocytes are diminished and, thus, non-parenchymal cells must assume the role of DNA replication instead, the priming stage starts 48 hours after partial hepatectomy (PH).</p>
                        <p>In mice, DNA synthesis begins 36-40 hours after PH.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Liver Regeneration as an Increasingly Complicated Subject: the Proliferation Stage</h2>
                        <p>The proliferation stage plays out in two acts: the complete mitogens and the auxiliary mitogens. Complete mitogens include epidermal growth factor (EGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and other proteins that induce cell proliferation. Auxiliary mitogens do not promote such a response as complete mitogens, but rather accelerate the tendencies of complete mitogens in hepatocytes.</p>
                        <p>Complete mitogens work by bonding Ras-MAPK signaling and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways with their corresponding receptors c-met and EGFR. Bonded Ras-MAPK signaling and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways bridge signals from external cell conditions to the nucleus where they activate genes that take a cell through mitosis. Consequently, this promotes the proliferation of hepatocytes and brings hepatocytes from the G1 stage of priming to mitosis.</p>
                        <p>Auxiliary mitogens include insulin-like growth factor system (IGF system), bile acids (BAs), serotonin, and others. In addition to accelerating the process of complete mitogens in hepatocytes, auxiliary mitogens can also delay liver regeneration when complete mitogens are unavailable.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Liver Regeneration as a Miracle: the Termination Stage</h2>
                        <p>Normal liver mass contributes 3% to a human’s body weight and only ~1.6 rounds of the proliferation of hepatocytes are needed to fully regrow the removed lobes of the liver. Thus, the termination stage of liver regeneration plays an important role in maintaining a healthy organ. It still remains unknown how the proliferation stage is immediately ended when enough liver mass has been regenerated, but it has been generally accepted that transforming growth factor &beta; (TGF&beta;), which had been inhibited in the priming stage, plays a role since the expression of TGF&beta; in hepatocytes reaches a peak after DNA synthesis ends. Thus, this is where liver regeneration concludes.</p>
