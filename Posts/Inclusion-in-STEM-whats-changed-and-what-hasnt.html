                        <h2 class="section-heading">What is STEM?</h2>
                        <p>STEM- an acronym coined in 2001 by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF)[1]- refers to the field of study of <b>S</b>cience, <b>T</b>echnology, <b>E</b>ngineering, and <b>M</b>athematics. Although the four fields involved have existed long before then, they came together officially in 2001 under a big umbrella. Since then, public and private organizations have worked together to kindle students’ interests in STEM as a whole and bridge all gender and ethnic gaps. This article aims to examine inclusion in STEM then and now from these 2 perspectives, highlighting what has changed and what hasn’t.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">1. The Gender Gap</h2>
                        <p>It’s no secret that women have always been underrepresented in STEM fields. Due to societal and psychological factors, women have only been trying to meet up with their male counterparts in fields related to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.Thanks to pacesetters like Emelie du Chatelet [2], Ada Lovelace[3], Phoebe Omlie [4], Mary Winston Jackson[5], Hypatia [6] and many more women, more and more girls are getting inspired and venturing into STEM. These women who ventured into unknown territories as the minority and made names for themselves will never cease to be celebrated as female STEM pioneers who paved the way for future generations.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, not everybody’s eyes and minds have been opened to the possibilities of females working in operating rooms, war fields, construction sites, programming labs, and space stations. Although the percentage of women working in STEM-related fields has seen a general increase, there is still much ground to be covered as women make up only 28% of workers in STEM and men outnumber women majoring in most STEM undergraduate majors [7].</p>
                        <p>There are many factors responsible for this huge imbalance, the majority of which have their roots in society and psychology. Let’s now take a deeper look at those factors, shall we?</p>
                        <p>First off, societal factors. These are expressed in form of discrimination, stereotypes, harassment, lack of support, lack of mentorship, and many more. Many girls are told that STEM jobs are for men and so are discouraged from pursuing careers in those areas. The few who decide to still go for it may be subject to harassment from co-workers or even employers of labour. In addition, while more women are starting to step up, there still aren’t many visible public figures ready to stand as role models for young women in STEM and offer free mentoring. As a result, young females who are struggling to hold their positions as STEM students have no one to look up to and share their concerns and burdens with. Coupled with the fact that society considers such ladies weird and labels them ‘manly’, many find it difficult to embrace their interests in STEM and try to stick with the ideal picture of femininity that society imposes instead. This ideal picture portrays a frail woman who would much rather not have deep thoughts or get involved in strenuous work. This picture tells girls they do not need to dream big and should be content with just supporting roles. This picture tells girls that they do not have the capacity and so should not have the will to do great things. But the fact is, this picture is wrong! Girls should have deep thoughts or get involved in strenuous work. Girls should dream big and not be content with just supporting roles. Girls should have the capacity and will to do great things.</p>
                        <p>Next, are psychological factors. These factors are expressed in the form of lack of interest, lack of confidence, and stereotype threat. One important thing to note is that psychological factors are often caused by societal factors. Due to all the discouragement and lack of support a girl faces in society, it is not uncommon and should not be surprising to see her lose interest and confidence in what she was previously attached to.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">2. The Ethnic/Racial Gap</h2>
                        <p>The ethnic gap discovered in STEM is quite interesting. It shows that although interest in STEM fields might not differ so markedly according to race, persistence and retention do. It has been proven that compared to their ethnic majority counterparts, students from Underrepresented Minority Groups (URM ) [8] who declare STEM majors do not go on to earn their STEM degrees[9]. This case deals with aggravated aggression towards URM STEM students and considers only Whites, Asians, and Indians as true engineers [10].</p>
                        <p>As with the gender gap, there are many reasons for this racial divide in STEM, with the root cause being racism itself. Many college students have testified to needing to handle racist comments and behaviors targeted towards them while pursuing their STEM degrees[11]. Needless to say, this discourages them from going on to earn their degrees and results in them dropping out or changing their majors.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">What’s Changed and What Hasn’t</h2>
                        <p>Based on all that has been discussed above, it is evident that although these gaps have been narrowed, they are still worth worrying about. To some extent, inclusion in STEM has been achieved but there is still much work to be done before we can consider ourselves successful.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Achieving Inclusion in STEM</h2>
                        <p>Having tasked ourselves with the responsibility of reaching a state of all-rounded inclusion in STEM, we need to identify the various roles that we have to play. By putting into action the following simple but significant points, inclusion in STEM might slowly but will surely be achieved.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>We must jettison baseless stereotypes and embrace a world of equal rights and opportunities.</li>
                            <li>While jettisoning these stereotypes, we must also strive to educate those around us who need to be helped out of their ignorance and narrow-mindedness so as to create a supportive environment for females and URM students who decide to venture into STEM.</li>
                            <li>We must encourage female and URM students around us to pursue their STEM dreams. Our words and actions must translate into support and love, not cynicism or hatred. <br>Female and URM STEM students must learn to look only to themselves for affirmation and validation of their dreams. They must learn to only say, “Yes, I can!”</li>
                            <li>It is also advisable for female and URM STEM students to have STEM role models and research them. They’ll be sure to pick up many tips on pursuing their dreams regardless of what others say.</li>
                            <li>High schools and higher education institutions should make concise and deliberate efforts to draw in female and URM students to STEM fields.</li>
                            <li>Higher institutions should have special help services and communities for female and URM STEM students who are being harassed and discriminated against.</li>
                            <li>More funding and scholarships should be created for female and URM STEM students to encourage and enable them to pursue their STEM dreams.</li>
                            <li>It is also advisable for female and URM STEM students to have STEM role models and research them. They’ll be sure to pick up many tips on pursuing their dreams regardless of what others say.</li>
