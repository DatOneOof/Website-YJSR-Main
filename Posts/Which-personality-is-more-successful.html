                        <h2 class="section-heading">First off, what is the difference between a Type A and Type B personality?</h2>
                        <p>People with Type A personality are statistically more successful than people with Type B personality. However, though there may be many determinants that affect the type of personality a person has, people can merely possess an inborn personality that may be altered a bit as they grow up in their distinguished environment.</p>
                        <p>A person with a Type A personality is talented in multitasking. People with this personality are extremely competitive, organized, impatient, possess hate for wasting time, and dedicate most of their time to their work. However, a Type B personality entails being more philosophical and relaxed, not affected by failures, and are highly-flexible with their work schedules. People with a Type A personality have the unique ability to have a direct focus that allows them to productively work long hours alone, which is part of why they’re so successful.They are intrinsically motivated to be self-accomplished and don’t accept failure easily: in which they urge themselves to work harder, to persevere, and are much more extroverted than a Type B personality, which aids them in many business and other social settings where confidence and assertiveness are needed. However, a Type A personality has a much more scheduled work and general schedule geared towards being successful.</p>
                        <p>Studies show that people with more of a fixed work schedule, which results in higher productivity, gain a higher salary than people who are more flexible with their time: in which data from “Truity Psychometrics” using Myers–Briggs Type Indicator discovered “that a Type A personality was seen to have the highest-earning personality type, with traits of extroversion, sensing, and thinking, and judging with a salary of $77,000/year. The lowest-earning personality type was associated with “introversion, sensing, and perceiving with an average of $32,000/year.” This conveys that most successful people in society have Type A traits, such as determinism, relentlessness, ambition, and competitiveness.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Can Birth Order affect the type of personality a person has?</h2>
                        <p>Alfred Adler’s 20th century birth order theory states that firstborns displayed a high level of neuroticism, in which they were much more self-critical, conforming and dependent on others, coinciding with a trend seen, which showed that firstborns were more likely to conform to social parameters, not stray from their parents’ beliefs, and possess a non-rebellious nature since they do not have to compete for parental attention for some time before their younger siblings are born, making them more easy-going and less temperamental. They are classified as possessing a Type B personality, in which these qualities aren’t dominant in showing high results in attaining success. Birth order theory also states that younger siblings were said to be more independent, and possess the urge to try to solve problems or find “creative approaches” to solutions on their own rather than enlisting aid, which coincides with data showing that younger siblings were more questionable of their parents’ views, defiant of societies rules, social, as well as risk-taking due to parent’s giving all their rigid “resources'' to their firstborns, while the later borns are subject to crafting their own likes and wants. They exert the qualities that contribute to one’s success, and are therefore classified as a Type A personality.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Is a child’s personality inborn or conditioned: Nature or Nurture?</h2>
                        <p>Though it is an ongoing debate, studies have thus shown that it is both. Frank Sulloway’s 1966 novel, Born to Rebel, relates to The Big Five Personality traits (extraversion, agreeableness, openness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism), in which older siblings displayed less extraversion and openness, which exhibits a correlation with a Type B personality, which results in less success. However, a baby is not always born with specific ingrained personality traits based on their order; it is shown that environmental factors, such as how a child was raised, have a cognitive impact on a child, and can alter and affect their personality.</p>
                        <p>The Sulloway 2018 study of Swedish siblings garnered that firstborns were more inclined to hold leadership positions, whereas more later-borns succeeded in being self-employed, coinciding with a Type A personality. Sulloway and several of his colleagues also conducted a meta-analysis of 24 prior studies involving birth order and participation in dangerous sports. The chances of later borns participating in these high-risk sports were nearly two times greater than firstborns: in which one of them was a performance study. The study was done on 700 brothers who played major league baseball. The younger brothers were about “eleven times more likely to attempt the high-risk activity of base stealing and three times more likely to steal bases successfully,” and also surpassed the older brothers in batting performance and career success, in which a few of the measures were linked to risk-taking. These studies exhibit that birth order does affect the type of personality one has, and their success.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Does gender affect the successfulness of a person?</h2>
                        <p>The answer is: NO. Though gender is seen to be a contributing factor in success, it is mainly due to society’s discrimination of women as compared to men in the workplace. Type A women tend to show greater competitiveness, “autonomic arousal to laboratory stressors,” as well as more “goal-directedness,” and a preference to work in solidarity under strenuous conditions, as compared to Type B women. These traits can also be seen in men.</p>
                        <p>Researchers found that even though both sexes are “remarkably similar in terms of childhood experiences, work and leadership styles, and personality traits-” such as confidence, resilience, self-esteem, and leadership, and managerial skills “-women’s success is less than that of men. It was reported that an overwhelming 77% of women encountered sexism while working, as compared to only 6% of men. In addition, although 94% of men were reported to be the primary earner of the family, while 59% of women reported so, women also reported that they had to bear the responsibilities of taking care of household chores and tend to the children 44% in comparison to 4% of men, hindering many of them from being the “primary earner” in the family. Despite these societal restraints, “women now have an uninterrupted 35-year record of earning the majority of bachelor’s degrees in the U.S. that started back in 1982.” The majority of these women most likely had a Type A personality, and possess traits that dominate the success rates in society as compared to men that have the same qualities. Numerous studies reveal that the majority of women don’t receive as much encouragement or opportunities to pursue certain fields dominated by men, such as business, and societal restraints hinder more women than men.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">How does parenting styles affect a person’s personality and their future successes?</h2>
                        <p>Parenting styles are seen to greatly contribute to whether a person acquires more of a Type A or Type B personality, as well as their success. The three main parenting styles are: authoritative, authoritarian, and permissive. Parents that utilize an authoritative parenting style raise their kids to express their emotions, learn self-discipline, give a reason for their punishments, and reframe from using corporal punishment. An authoritative parenting style sounds very similar to a “totalitarian” parenting style, which is exactly as it is. Parents that utilize this parenting style emotionally degrade their children, give harsh punishments, as well as give no reason for them if the child has done something wrong, and always respond, “because I said so!” A permissive parenting style is also very negative to a child’s development for these parents do not give any regulations or care to their children’s actions, producing selfish and neglected behavior in the child, which leaves them feeling unloved.</p>
                        <p>In comparison with authoritarian and permissive parenting styles, an authoritative one has been frequently seen to have “positive developmental outcomes in youth” of a child, such as “psychosocial competence,” in which a child acquires emotional stability, “maturation, resilience, optimism, self-reliance, social competence, self-esteem, and academic achievement,” all traits that contribute to developing a Type A personality, as well achieving success.</p>
                        <p>This is so because there is open communication between the child and parents, in which the parents give reasons for their rules or regulations, allowing the child to gain self-control and discipline, and feel able to express their emotions. Authoritative parenting is also proven to have beneficial effects in coping with conflict at an early age, which in turn contributes to having resilience in adulthood, coinciding with a dominant Type A trait, which is useful in attaining success in one’s life. An authoritarian, permissive, and neglectful parenting style, however, leads to a child having depression, behavior problems, and a lack of self-control, all very negative outcomes of these parenting styles. They internalize harmful emotions and externalize those emotions in their behavior both at home and in school. An authoritative parenting style is overall the most beneficial parenting style that contributes to the development of a Type A personality, and qualities that contribute to academic and career success.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">So, can someone be successful even if they identify as a Type B personality?</h2>
                        <p>Yes! Turns out, there are many types of personalities, like Type C, D, E, F, and many more, but Type A and Type B are the most identified and common. Birth order, gender, and parenting style are all contributors to the amount of success one has in life in accordance with a person who has a Type A personality attaining more success than one that possesses a Type B personality. Although this may be true through statistics and studies, it is merely a person's ambition and skill, whether introverted or extroverted, that contribute to their success. A Type A or Type B personality can bring one success; it is up to a person’s tenacity to allow themselves to push forward and achieve their goals no matter what their personality is identified as.</p>
