                        <!-- Main Content/ Article Body -->
                        <p>Gillick competence is a term originating in England and Wales and is used internationally in medical law to determine whether a child, under the age of 16, has the capacity to consent to their own medical treatment without parental permission or knowledge. 


<br><br>[1] It was introduced as a result of the Gillick v West Norfolk and Wisbech Area Health Authority case where Victoria Gillick wanted to challenge the government advice as unlawful, however in the end, the advice was ruled as lawful, that a child under 16 could give valid consent to medical treatment, including contraception or abortion, without parental knowledge or authority. The case was originally about contraception, but the term ‘Gillick competent’ had spread into other areas of healthcare and treatment.


<br><br>[2] When a medical professional assesses the child’s competency, they need to consider the following:</p>
                        
                        <ul class="cont-list">
                            <li>The child’s age, maturity and mental capacity</li>
                            <li>their understanding of the issue and what it involves - including advantages, disadvantages and potential long-term impact.</li>
<li>their understanding of the risks, implications and consequences that may arise from their decision.</li>
<li>how well they understand any advice or information they have been given.</li>
<li>their understanding of any alternative options, if available.</li>
<li>their ability to explain a rationale around their reasoning and decision making.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>If the child passes this test, the child is deemed ‘Gillick competent’. However, as with adults in the UK, the consent is not valid if the child is being pressured or influenced by someone else. Additionally, Gillick competence is assessed differently in various situations due to different factors, such as stress and mental health, as well as the complexities of the decisions needed to be made. </p>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Is this affected by age?</h2>
                        
                        <p>[3] While there is no lower age limit for Gillick competence, the Care Quality Commission suggests that it would be rarely appropriate to allow children under 13 years of age to consent to treatment, and when it comes to sexual health, the UK laws state that those under 13 are unable to consent to sexual activity, therefore any information that a person is sexually active would need to be acted on, regardless of Gillick competence.<br><br>
16-17 year olds and under are considered to have the capacity (the decision-making ability) of an adult, however this is sometimes overridden by a parent, someone with parental responsibility, or a court, if the circumstances lead to death, permanent injury, or irreversible mental or physical harm. This is due to the medical professional’s overriding duty to act in the child’s best interests.
</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Treatment refusal and Jehovah’s Witnesses:</h2>
                        
                        <p>A Jehovah’s Witness is a part of Christianity, in which people of this faith believe that it is against God’s will to receive blood transfusions, hence a non-consensual blood transfusion would be considered a gross physical violation. 
<p>So how does this relate to Gillick competence?</p>
<p>In November 2020, a 15 year old patient in the UK had sickle-cell anaemia and was in need of an urgent blood transfusion to sustain her life. Being a devoted Jehovah’s Witness, the patient refused the blood transfusion and was taken to court, due to the urgency of the situation. While the patient was assessed to be ‘Gillick competent’ and nearing 16 years of age, the court had ruled in favour of the blood transfusion as the patient had hours left to live and action was imperatively needed. This case, along with many similar cases present an ethical dilemma; a patient with Gillick competence can accept life-saving treatment, but cannot refuse it, despite their religious or strong beliefs. Read about the case here: <a href="https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Fam/2020/3003.html">https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Fam/2020/3003.html</a></p>
<p>On one hand, we have a teenager who has hours left to live, who may be robbed of a future should the patient not receive the treatment, and on the other hand, the non-consensual blood transfusion has gone against patient autonomy and beliefs. The patient may be traumatised or feel invaded, and may not trust the healthcare system to respect her wishes in the future.</p>
<p>What would you choose: the complete respect for patient autonomy or to act in the patient’s best wishes?</p>
