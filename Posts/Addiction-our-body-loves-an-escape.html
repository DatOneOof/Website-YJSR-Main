                        <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>It’s no shock addiction has become a huge barrier in our world. Due to the complex nature of addiction to either chemical or behavioral enhancements, our society is riddled with drugs, stereotypes, and hopelessness for our future. During your time reading this piece, my story of dealing with addiction will help you understand the science behind it and how it affects the body. We’ll learn how addiction is used to cope with trauma and stress, and why we may depend on these things to structure our lives.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">My Point of View</h2>
                        <p>I am currently 16 years old. I grew up in a town in California where drugs and smoking are second nature, especially in my family. My mother grew up with most of her family doing drugs. My father grew up around drugs because of his parents and the people he was brought up around. My grandmothers are both addicts, and one has already passed away. We chose to cut off contact with my mother's side of the family because of their lifestyle choices. I no longer talk to my grandmother because of her lifestyle choices. My parents, both previous addicts, always raised me with morals and values so I could have a good chance at living a happy life regardless of having a very small and limited family who valued drugs more than they valued a relationship with me. I grew up hearing and seeing very traumatic things regarding drugs and addiction. I remember I was staying the night with my grandmother about a year ago and she was very heavily medicated. My grandfather and she were arguing as they normally do, then she made a comment saying “If I couldn’t get my pills, I will go to heroin and inject it in between my toes so nobody would know.” After hearing that, my mind immediately went to how she promised me she was getting better and doing well without the pills. I am very grateful I grew up with my parents being so honest and truthful about their past and also my family's past habits they never broke such as certain phrases they continuously used to excuse their actions. These phrases being along the lines of, “I need money for your grandmother” or “I miss my son (my father)“ to be able to obtain sympathy and money to fund their addictions. Being very young when I was exposed to the wrong side of the world really altered my relationship with myself and my family. A tactic of addiction is also manipulation whether it's yourself or others around you. My grandmother uses manipulation to either get money to buy substances or use my great grandmother, who they live with and care for as a pawn. In my time in this world, I have learned more about the dark side of addiction rather than the good things that come in life. In my head, I was more disappointed than anytime I have ever been before. I just wanted my grandmother to realize how badly she damaged me with her choices. I never knew my mother’s family. It started to recently affect me more because I am starting to develop my life and am realizing how I have missed out on lots of experiences that are common for a functional family like having a favorite cousin, family parties, and family visits. The only kids I grew up with are my siblings. All I have ever wanted is to be like other families and I know how that sounds but it hurts me to think about my family and their choices. If any good has come out of it, I know the red flags to look out for in people and I know the exact person that I do not ever want to become. If I could say one thing to my family who chose drugs over me, I would say “If there was even a choice between me and the drugs, pick the drugs because if there was any love there for me, there wouldn't even be a choice. I wish every single day on every single star I see that you guys are choosing better for yourselves and realizing your mistakes day by day and changing for the better of yourselves”.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">The Science Behind Addiction</h2>
                        <p>The science behind addiction is very complex and very challenging to put into an explanation. When drugs or anything really addictive comes into our body, depending on what it does for us, some drugs make you euphoric, sleepy, or just energetic to function throughout the day. After we experience those feelings, it makes us want to take more to re-experience those feelings and depend on them more to function through the day. Sometimes regardless of the physical or mental pain to do these things. Our brains start to change to depend on the drugs for normal functions. Without them, our brains try to make up the simulation missing which causes withdrawal symptoms as these higher levels of euphoria are decreased.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>The absolute best thing you can do is to maintain a healthy lifestyle free of addictive substances. If you or a person you know is in danger because of drugs or addiction, please let a healthcare professional know and seek help. Reach out and get help. You are worth something and deserve it. </p>
