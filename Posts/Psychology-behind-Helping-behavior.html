                        <p>Helping behavior is a fascinating aspect of social psychology and has been a focus of discussion or interest for psychologists since years. There are a range of different explanations for helping behavior and a variety of environmental, psychological, and social influences suggested by psychologists. There was a study conducted by Piliavin et al. called the "subway samaritans' ' which explored the underlying psychological mechanisms that drive helping behavior or altruistic behavior.
The term subway samaritans is used to refer to the people in the subway who helped others in distress. This study was carefully planned and conducted in a way that eliminated any possible extraneous variables that could affect the findings.<br><br>

There are psychological mechanisms derving altruistic actions or helping behavior; however, there is an effect called the bystander effect that leads to the diffusion of responsibility, which explains the psychological mechanism that prevents individuals from offering help. The bystander effect is when an individual is less likely to help in the presence of others because they have assumed that others might have already helped or will help. For example, in a crowded public place like a mall, if someone faints, an individual will assume that someone amongst the people in the mall might have already called an ambulance, and therefore it will be less likely for that individual to help that person who fainted due to the presence of a lot of people in the mall. Whereas when someone is alone with a person in need of help, they are more likely to help, as there are no other people who can help that person besides them. The presence of many bystanders can lead to "diffusion of responsibility" , a phenomenon suggested by Darley and Latané to be the reason why 38 bystanders did not do anything to prevent the murder of Kitty Genovese in 1964.However, in the study (subway samaritans), no diffusion of responsibility was found despite the presence of numerous bystanders. This led psychologists to investigate the factors that override the bystander effect.<br><br>
Empathy and altruism are both crucial psychological mechanisms that cause helping behavior. Empathy is the ability to understand another person’s feelings and thoughts from their point of view; therefore, when a person is empathetic towards someone, they are more likely to help them.Altruism is doing a selfless act or helping someone, even at a risk to oneself and without expecting any personal gain. Altruistic actions can be a major driving force behind helping behavior, as it is considered a higher form of prosocial behavior. It can be influenced by a range of factors, which include moral values, social norms, and personality traits.<br><br>
Other factors causing helping behavior include personal characteristics. It was noted that subway samaritans were influenced by personal characteristics when deciding whether to help or not. Same-race helping behavior was recorded in the study; therefore, this demonstrates that people are more likely to help those who have similar characteristics as them.<br><br>
Similarly, social norms can be a reason for helping behavior, as in many societies, helping behavior is taught to children and is a moral value to help others in distress; therefore, people living in such societies are more likely to offer help. In some societies, it's more a personal choice to help others than a moral value or obligation.<br><br>


Piliavin et al. put forward the cost-benefit model to explain the results of the study, which involves a decision-making process in which a person weighs up the advantages and disadvantages of helping; if there is a risk, the person might refrain from helping, and if there is none, they are more likely to help.<br><br>
Therefore, helping a victim, according to Piliavin et al., is based on a cost-benefit analysis and the level of emotional arousal. The original study states, <i>"Note that the major motivation implied in the model is not a positive "altruistic" one, but rather a selfish desire to rid oneself of an unpleasant emotional state.</i><br><br>

The complex psychological mechanisms deriving helping behavior are still being studied by psychologists so that the possible deriving factors and influences can be identified and understood in great detail. The study of "Subway Samaritans" plays a vital role in the understanding of psychological mechanisms and factors causing and influencing helping behavior. Empathy, social norms, altruism, and personal characteristics are all factors and psychological mechanisms that determine the decision to help a person in need. These psychological explanations play a crucial role in the understanding of complex human behaviors. Helping behavior strengthens social bonds and establishes a sense of community within society.<br><br>
