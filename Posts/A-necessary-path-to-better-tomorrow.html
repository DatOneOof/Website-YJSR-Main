            <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              The world is incessantly facing the consequences of human-driven
              environmental emergencies such as climate change. In the many
              proposed solutions of mitigating the change in climate, rewilding
              has come up as one of the most propitious. But, there is always
              more to it than what meets the eye. The restoration of megafaunas
              through trophic rewilding is a controversial yet opportune
              approach to address ecological degradation.
            </p>
            <p>
              The greenhouse effect is the main driver of climate change. This
              effect is natural, but it is amplified by greenhouse gas emissions
              which, as a result, traps more heat inside the earth’s atmosphere,
              causing global repercussions. According to the Center for Climate
              and Energy Solutions or C2ES, carbon dioxide emissions (primarily
              from the combustion of fossil fuels) have risen dramatically since
              the start of the industrial revolution; And carbon dioxide
              accounts for about 76 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Trophic rewilding, and ecological restoration efforts in general,
              came about to aid in increasing carbon sequestration, promoting
              biodiversity, and improving the carbon stocks of forests and
              ecosystems around the world. There is mounting evidence that the
              widespread loss of wildlife, often known as defaunation, affects
              not only the animals themselves but also the vital functions they
              play in ecosystems. So rewilding is a novel ecological restoration
              method that has been developed to replace these lost functions. It
              focuses on reintroducing missing major animal species or, in the
              event that they become extinct, their proxies in an effort to
              restore natural processes in ecosystems as a whole.
            </p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">
              Is it an effective and sustainable climate solution?
            </h2>
            <p>
              By safeguarding and expanding carbon capture and storage in
              plants, soils, and sediments in ecosystems, natural climate
              solutions are being pushed to stop climate change. In addition to
              conserving animal species diversity, these solutions are seen as
              having a secondary benefit of preserving habitats and landscapes.
              This reasoning, however, undervalues the part that animals play in
              regulating the carbon cycle. In a recent study, scientific proof
              has been presented on how preserving wild animals and their
              ecological functions can improve natural carbon capture and
              storage.(Schmitz et al., 2023) We must acknowledge the restoration
              and preservation of wild animals and their ecological functions as
              an essential part of natural climate solutions that can improve
              our efforts to prevent global warming beyond 1.5 °C. Since trophic
              rewilding relies heavily on reinstating existing ecological
              dynamics and natural processes that have been maintained for years
              and years, it is most definitely sustainable and adequately
              long-term.
            </p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">Potential risks</h2>
            <p>
              However, there are still risks involved. What makes trophic
              rewilding controversial is the possibility of exotic species
              proliferation as a consequence of rewilding. Rewilding varies from
              simple reintroduction in that it focuses primarily on restoring
              species that have a high capacity to exert impact across several
              trophic levels, with the expectation that these species will have
              drastically significant and advantageous effects on communities
              and other organisms and habitats. The concern is that the
              consequences of introducing a predator or dominating herbivore on
              a population or ecosystem are difficult to foresee with precision.
              It is suggested by Nogués-Bravo et al. (2016) that those that
              favor of trophic rewilding should properly take into account its
              potential for long-lasting effects and promote basic research that
              presents potential future conditions of ecosystems following
              rewilding.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is also important to recognize that rewilding promotes novel
              approaches to land management that are centered on re-establishing
              the independent, diversity-maintaining mechanisms already found in
              nature. If successful, trophic rewilding could provide higher
              resistance and resilience to the effects from climate change by
              restoring more robust ecosystems. (Bakker & Svenning, 2018)
