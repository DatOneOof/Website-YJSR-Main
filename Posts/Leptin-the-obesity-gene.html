                        <p>Whenever we hear the word ‘hormone’, we think about the chemicals raging through
our bodies, responsible for our deep voices, unpredictable moodiness, and tragically, our wild acne. But what we fail to see is a vast, complex system of cell communication. We owe a lot to hormones; they are, after all, the juices which run the intricate factory known as the Human Body. Over the past few years, a new discovery has caught the eyes of endocrinologists worldwide. We now welcome one more to our long list of chemical
messengers: Leptin . Even with the limited  knowledge we have, its effect on our
bodies is deemed fascinatingly enormous. From controlling our appetite, to regulating vital processes such as puberty and pregnancy, Leptin may play a huge role in the future of weight loss treatment and maintaining a healthy physiology.
</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Discovery:</h2>
                        
                        <p>The peculiar hormone was first identified by geneticists Jeffrey Friedman and Douglas Coleman, in 1994 New York. It was found to be a product of the ob (obesity) gene in mice. By studying a recessive, mutated colony (which lacked the ob gene), it was presumed that a circulatory component ,secreted by adipocytes (fat cells beneath your skin) - and not a dedicated gland-  was responsible for regulating their food intake, and thus, energy expenditure. Further analysis soon confirmed the hypothesis.  Upon purification, the  factor was then classified as a hormone, and was given the name Leptin (‘thin’ in Latin). When the same test group (which initially showed signs of polyphagia/ extreme appetite)  was subjected to Leptin treatment, the mice  showed a significant loss in fatty mass. This siesmic discovery would soon become a popular topic of study, as various experiments and researches were swiftly conducted not only to understand how the chemical was produced, but what it was produced for.

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Importance in the body:</h2>
                        
                        <p>As mentioned previously, the first discovered role of Leptin  was to manage hunger and food intake. It was recognized that the protein was responsible to initiate a negative feedback signal to the brain (specifically, the receptors of the hypothalamus) when the energy stores in the body were at a satisfactory level; the result being increased energy expenditure (decreasing triglyceride levels) and the inhibition of excessive eating. This is also referred to as a satiety signalling mechanism, and meant that improper leptin levels in the circulatory system were a crucial indicator of obesity related health problems. This was further proved by research conducted on “leptin resistance” found in both human<br><br>

However, as an adipokine, Leptin is essential for various other processes, for which food supply and environmental stability is vital; the availability of resources has an influential role in controlling  reproductive processes. Severe  nutritional deficiency can prevent reproduction to ensure the organism’s immediate survival  by reducing levels of the pituitary luteinizing hormone (LH). Even the onset of puberty is highly affected by the maturing animal’s threshold level of body fat and overall nutrition.  Recent research has unravelled that leptin surges in the body are the primary signal for the initiation of such mechanisms: from controlling the release of the hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone GnRH (which, in turn, controls LH), to determining the secretion of the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and others. Studies analysing the modification of the post natal leptin flow in mice have displayed delayed testicular and ovarian growth, decreased levels of the mentioned hormones, and hence, the delayed onset of puberty. Female mice lacking leptin receptors in gonadotropes (cells in the anterior pituitary)  had evidently  reduced levels of GnRH receptors, further emphasising leptin's role in reproductive management.

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion: Leptin’s future?:</h2>
                        
                        <p>Leptin’s contributions in a wide variety of processes has deemed it a critical aspect in medical application. The future of treating metabolic disorders, including anorexic behaviours and obesity, heavily relies on understanding the relationship between leptin and its host body; the idea of  restoring leptin sensitivity in resistant populations provides hope in the world of pharmacy, fertility treatment, and even immunology as a whole. 
Previously unappreciated, the hormone has proved, and will continue to prove its importance in our physiological development and health.
