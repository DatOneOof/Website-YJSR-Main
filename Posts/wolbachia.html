                        <p>Diseases transmitted from mosquitoes cause a high number of infections and deaths yearly. Many vector control strategies have attempted to reduce or even eliminate mosquito populations and, by extension, disease infections.</p>
                        <p>However, many come with great drawbacks. A lesser-known method uses the bacteria Wolbachia and so far it has been successful.</p>
                        <h2 class ="section heading" id="cont-7">VECTOR CONTROL</h2>
                        <p>Devastating diseases such as malaria, dengue, Zika, chikungunya, and yellow fever are carried and spread by mosquitoes. Declared as global health crises by the World Health Organization, these mosquito-borne diseases (MBD) infect 700 million people and kill 1 million people annually.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, MBDs disproportionately affect developing nations due to their polluted water sources, unsanitary environments, lack of awareness for MBDs, low national budgets, and a general absence of widespread vaccine campaigns. Infected people in developing nations are also at a disadvantage as most cannot afford hospitalization or even treatment, resulting in high death tolls. Thus, in these nations, vector control offers a cheap and reliable solution.</p>
                        <p>Generally speaking, vector control is the limiting or complete destruction of an animal species. In the case of MBDs, mosquito vector control is the method in focus. The Aedes aegypti (Aedes mosquitoes) are the primary host for dengue, Zika, chikungunya, and yellow fever</p>
                        <p>This mosquito species is native to Africa, but they are now mostly found in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. They cause 50 million infections and 300,000 deaths yearly.</p>
                        <p> Many vector control strategies have been long employed against Aedes mosquitoes, including insecticide use and elimination of mosquito breeding areas. However, these strategies are more detrimental than beneficial.</p>
                        <p>Insecticide use has been shown by research to have little effect on mosquito populations in the wild while simultaneously causing extensive harm to humans and the environment. Moreover, the strategy is unsustainable for the high price associated with its required continuous use.</p>
                        <p>Likewise, the technique to eliminate mosquito breeding habitats is unsustainable. Mosquitoes prefer to lay their eggs in dark containers of any size. In urban areas where these containers are plentiful, total destruction of mosquito breeding areas will be expensive and, even, impossible. In disproportionately-affected developing nations, such a high price cannot be risked.</p>
                        <h2 class ="section heading" id="cont-7">WOLBACHIA </h2>
                        <p>Wolbachia has been highly considered as an Aedes mosquito vector control. Discovered back in 1924 by Marshall Hertig and Samuel Wolbach, Wolbachia is an endosymbiotic bacteria that changes host reproductive biology to ensure its mass spread.</p>
                        <p>This change is called cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) in which Wolbachia-infected females produce infected eggs when mating with either uninfected or infected males.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, when Wolbachia-infected males mate with uninfected females, the resulting eggs will not hatch. This egg mortality suppresses uninfected populations, allowing for a higher number of infected mosquitoes to be created each generation. </p>
                        <p>This unique CI suppression in Wolbachia garnered fame as it was quickly applied to reduce wild Aedes mosquito populations using the wMelPop strain. wMelPop was documented to shorten life spans through brain and muscle degeneration.</p>
                        <p>By releasing infected mosquitoes that would mate with uninfected mosquitoes in the wild, wMelPop would spare enough time for its spread through reproduction but also kill before the mosquito could spread MBDs. </p>
                        <p>This is possible because MBDs require an “incubation” period in the mosquito to replicate and spread to vital organs before infecting other victims. wMelPop, however, cuts lifespans before that period can be finished.</p>
                        <p>Nonetheless, numerous lab-based experiments had demonstrated wMelPop having low sustain rates, and this was the case in the wild as well. Although wMelPop had invaded wild Aedes populations well and greatly reduced MBD infections, its persistence was extremely poor. A few weeks after the releases of infected mosquitoes ended, the number of wMelPop-carrying mosquitoes plummeted from a high average of 80% (of total population) to near zero. This suggested a need for continuous release, but the resulting costs were still high.</p>
                        <p>In this context, Wolbachia’s wMel strain was introduced to vector control. wMel is similar to wMelPop but it focuses on effective invasion and disease blocking rather than lifespan shortening.</p>
                        <p>Experiments carried out in semi-field conditions demonstrated that wMelPop was more powerful in reducing infections, while wMel was more powerful in sustaining in mosquito populations.</p>
                        <p>The method to which wMel Wolbachia disease blocking works still remains unknown.  Wolbachia invasion often completely prevents mosquitoes from being infected by MBDs. 3/4 trials from Hoffman’s 2011 study showed no disease detection in any tested wMel Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes.</p>
                        <p>Recent research has suggested that wMel Wolbachia merely stops virus replication in its host rather than entirely inhibiting infection from the start. This prevention of replication renders the intruding virus powerless and, therefore, unable to take over its host.</p>
                        <p>Even when MBDs manage to infect the host mosquito, disease transmission to humans is unlikely with wMel. Mosquitoes pass MBDs to humans through their saliva during a feeding cycle. Studies have shown that a high presence of wMel Wolbachia in the salivary gland inhibits MBD viruses from taking over and even appearing.</p>
                        <p>These inherent characteristics of wMel Wolbachia contributed to its overwhelming success in field studies. In Indonesia, Brazil, Australia, Vietnam, Colombia, and more, wMel application has demonstrated successful and effective invasions, reduction of MBDs, and long-term persistence years after releases end. </p>
                        <h2 class ="section heading" id="cont-7">CONCLUSION:</h2>
                        <p>Overall, the relatively low cost, sustainability, easy deployment, and quick results associated with Wolbachia vector control have gained the strategy significant recognition and funding from governments and various institutions.</p>
                        <p>Each year, more and more developing nations are using this strategy for their country’s benefit. Like many other experimental studies before it, these trials have also yielded great results. Thus, in the near future, a significant reduction in global deaths due to MBDs may be achieved through Wolbachia vector control.</p>
