                        <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>In the field of maternal health, one of the most commonly diagnosed pregnancy complications is preeclampsia. Rana et al. (2019) state that this hypertensive disorder affects approximately 5% to 7% of women each year and is responsible for more than 70,000 annual maternal deaths and 500,000 annual fetal deaths across the globe. It is also a significant contributor to maternal morbidity, maternal mortality, cesarean sections, intensive care admissions, and prematurity in the United States (Rana et al., 2019). While other pregnancy complications such as gestational diabetes or miscarriage may be more well-known to the public, preeclampsia has grown in notoriety in recent years as the research into the disease continues to expand and develop. This literature review will discuss the etiology and treatment of preeclampsia, in addition to contemporary health promotion research that can help prevent this disease among pregnant women.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">The Scientific and Medical History of Preeclampsia</h2>
                        <p>In the beginning, scientists had a difficult time characterizing preeclampsia as many argued about the organ system it primarily targeted. Erez et al. (2022) review the origins of preeclampsia and how scientists originally thought it was a pathology that affected the central nervous system due to the presence of seizures to our modern understanding of the disease, which characterizes it as a vascular disease. The researchers of the study also reviewed the data regarding the epidemiology of preeclampsia, which ultimately resulted in using diastolic hypertension and proteinuria as diagnostic measurements. The presence of diastolic hypertension and proteinuria was associated with an increased risk for fetal complications and birth defects. Preeclampsia is a “multisystemic disorder” (Erez et al., 2022, p. 792) regardless of the presence of hypertension and proteinuria. In terms of its clinical manifestation, toxins that enter the maternal circulation have been hypothesized to be the cause. Erez et al. (2022) recognize the current literature that investigates “putative toxins” but also acknowledge how evidence suggests that “products of an ischemic or a stressed placenta are responsible for the vascular changes” (Erez et al., 2022, p. 795) which are notably the defining characteristics of this hypertensive disorder. Additionally, the novel finding that “antiangiogenic factors” (Erez et al., 2022, p. 795) developed in the placenta and manage the function of endothelial cells and intravascular inflammation is integral to better understanding preeclampsia pathophysiology.</p>
                        <p>In order to effectively treat a disease through biological treatments, the biological mechanisms which the disease utilizes to hijack our organ systems must be clearly defined and understood. Jung et al. (2022) study the contemporary scientific literature surrounding the etiology, pathophysiology, and current understanding of preeclampsia. Jung et al. (2022) state how the common pathway for this disease involves the activation of endothelial cells, intravascular inflammation, and syncytiotrophoblast stress. Some diseases, however, increase one’s risk of developing preeclampsia. The mechanisms on which various pathologies rely on to function often produce additional physiological responses that lead to the development of an entirely different disease. For instance, Jung et al. (2022) explore the causal relationship between periodontal disease and maternal gut dysbiosis, which are linked to atherosclerosis, and discover these causal relationships in a subpopulation of patients with preeclampsia Furthermore, Jung et al. (2022) also study the novel SARS-COV-2 virus and its infections have been causally aligned to the development of preeclampsia. It is important to understand the intricate relationships between diseases so we can identify treatments that help resolve shared symptoms. Additional etiological factors that are reviewed by Jung et al. (2022)  include maternal-fetal immune tolerance, uteroplacental ischemia, the relationship between gestational diabetes mellitus and maternal obesity, autoimmune disorders, fetal complications, and endocrine system pathologies. While studying the biological mechanisms and complex relationships of other diseases in relation to preeclampsia seems inconsequential, discoveries in this area of research can help improve the quality of the standard treatments for this hypertensive disorder as well as the general understanding of its pathophysiology.</p>
                        <p>Understanding how preeclampsia works fundamentally from the cellular level to the organ system level is crucial in the response to addressing this sometimes fatal pregnancy complication, however, understanding the clinical challenges it poses is arguably vital to forming effective solutions. Rana et al. (2019) review the current literature regarding placental factors and abnormal placentation’s role in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. She discusses the applications of biomarker assays in order to distinguish the various levels of disease risk in clinical settings. The authors of the study also explored the metabolic and cardiovascular risks of mothers associated with gestational hypertensive disorders. Their findings call for an increased focus on “interventional studies”  (Rana et al., 2019, p. 1110) during the asymptomatic stage of the disorder to “delay the onset of cardiovascular disease in women” (Rana et al., 2019, p. 1110). As cardiovascular diseases continue to be the leading cause of death for both men and women across the United States, intervention studies may yield greater insight into how these diseases develop over time.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Experimental Treatments</h2>
                        <p>Biological treatments are the most common forms of intervention when it comes to treating preeclampsia, among other hypertensive disorders. However, since there is no standard protocol in terms of treating preeclampsia besides administering antihypertensive drugs in mild cases, researchers study experimental treatments in hopes of discovering effective strategies that address the disorder. For instance, Furuhashi et al. (2020) assess the clinical application and safety of tadalafil with female patients who were diagnosed with preeclampsia. Methods of the study include the close monitoring for altered maternal, fetal, and neonatal effects that may result from the tadalafil treatment among eight patients with preeclampsia. Results produced within the study showed no unfavorable effects on the patient at 10 mg/day of tadalafil. However, at 20 mg/day of tadalafil, grade 1 headaches among two patients and grade 1 palpitations among one were observed but went away within three days. Additionally, at the 40 mg/day of tadalafil dose, one case of grade 1 headaches was observed but was again resolved within the span of three days. No adverse neonatal or fetal effects were observed in the study. Furuhashi et al. (2020) conclude that the tadalafil treatment is effective and admissible. These findings prove that additional methods of treatment exist and can be applied based on the severity of the disease’s progression. However, since experimental treatments can often yield different results for different people, further study is required before tadalafil can be classified as a safe form of biological treatment.</p>
                        <p>In a clinical setting, aspirin is an anti-inflammatory drug often used to treat cases of fever, inflammation, and headache. Aspirin’s antihypertensive effects have been of keen interest among scientists and many research studies investigating their inherent biochemical properties have been conducted. However, can administering aspirin to women with preeclampsia yield adverse effects? Wright et al. (2019) examine and test the hypothesis that the effect of aspirin delays the delivery time of women diagnosed with preeclampsia. Methods of the study include splitting participants into two groups in order to emulate the delay hypothesis. This involves examining one group for preterm preeclampsia without aspirin, which is infrequent relative to term preeclampsia because a reduction in term preeclampsia is expected since few cases of preterm preeclampsia ever evolve to term preeclampsia. Meanwhile, another group for preterm preeclampsia to term preeclampsia by aspirin is examined to measure any effect on the incidence of term preeclampsia. A statistical model measuring the effect of aspirin and how it delays the gestational age at delivery was incorporated. Results from the study demonstrate consistent data that align with the delay hypothesis. In the lower-risk group, the incidence of term preeclampsia was reduced. Meanwhile, there was a small increase in the incidence of term preeclampsia in the higher-risk group. Researchers concluded that the trial data is indeed consistent with the hypothesis that “aspirin delays the gestational age at delivery” (Wright et al., 2019, p. 585) with pregnant women diagnosed with preeclampsia.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Preeclampsia: Health Promotion & Disease Prevention Research</h2>
                        <p>While studying treatment for diseases is important, studying how to prevent diseases is of far greater importance. Preventing illness is often much easier than treating it. Therefore studying ways in which we can promote health is vital in lowering mortality rates. Through health behavioral research scientists can identify behavioral patterns that lead to the pathogenesis of preeclampsia as well as come up with lifestyle-based solutions that combat disease progression. Rossiter et al. (2022) examine how women acquired positive health behaviors post-pregnancy with hypertensive disorders. Methods of the study involved recorded interviews by telephone, which were then analyzed and transcribed. Researchers assessed for any behavioral changes following a hypertensive pregnancy among those interviewed. The study’s results suggest three main themes among the thirty-four women who participated in the study. The first theme was the mother’s awareness of their cardiovascular risk, the second theme was sources of motivation to adopt a healthy lifestyle, and the final theme was maintaining that healthy behavior adaptation with their new baby. Researchers concluded that the majority of the study participants recognize their increased cardiovascular health risks and appear inspired to make improvements to their lifestyle choices. Modern medical practice is often too focused on complications affecting the baby, resulting in the mother’s needs being neglected after a successful delivery. These research findings help emphasize the importance of support for women both during pregnancy and after.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>Addressing this significant issue in the field of maternal health will be essential in helping tackle the major health disparities that many women endure. While all women are susceptible to developing preeclampsia, women of color and women from low socioeconomic backgrounds have been disproportionately affected. As previously stated, preeclampsia is classified as a hypertensive disorder so the complications it can pose to the successful delivery of the baby are significant. Throughout this literature review, the etiology and treatment of preeclampsia are discussed in order to inform the public about this notorious hypertensive disorder and spread awareness about the challenge it poses to pregnant women.</p>
