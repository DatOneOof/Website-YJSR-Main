                        <p>With the advent of Artificial Intelligence in our generation, concerns have arisen about the potential impact on various professions, ranging from basic consultants to software programmers. Neural networks have rapidly advanced, generating logos for companies, creating artwork, generating 3D models, and even generating photos of non-existent people. <br> <br> For instance, painter Jason Allen [1] won an art prize in an annual competition by creating an AI-generated picture. This situation has sparked fear among digital creators about the future and has raised concerns among traditional artists. However, it's important to note that the entire artwork was not solely created by AI; Mr. Allen used it as an inspiration and a tool, like Photoshop or other digital image manipulation software. <br> <br>“I couldn’t believe what I was seeing,” he said. “I felt like it was demonically inspired — like some otherworldly force was involved.” <br> <br> Another interesting application of neural networks is the Random Face Generator [2], which creates images of people who do not even exist. Although there may be some anatomical mistakes at times, the generated images can be difficult to distinguish from real humans.<br><br>So, should we worry, that AI will replace many creative professions? In my opinion, true professionals do not view AI as a threat to their work, but rather as a new opportunity to elevate the arts to the next level. We should strive to keep up with technological advancements and harness them to make the world a better place to live in.<br><br>But what if people start buying AI-generated paintings? Upon observing AI-generated artwork, one may notice similarities among the paintings. This is because AI is trained on internet-searched images [3] and generates generative models in a similar manner. However, it is possible that over time, AI may improve to a point where the differences between AI-generated and human-generated artwork become indistinguishable. Nevertheless, for true art enthusiasts, AI-generated artwork may lack the depth and meaning found in traditional paintings. However, for those seeking aesthetically pleasing artwork, AI-generated pieces may provide a more affordable option. <br><br>Additionally, the use of neural networks in the arts has also opened new avenues for collaborations between artists and AI systems. Many artists are now exploring the creative potential of working in tandem with AI, using it as a tool to augment their artistic process and push the boundaries of their artistic vision. This collaborative approach has resulted in unique and innovative artworks that blend the capabilities of AI with human creativity, showcasing the synergistic relationship between technology and art. Such collaborations offer exciting opportunities for artistic experimentation and exploration, further highlighting the evolving landscape of art in the age of AI.<br> <br>In conclusion, the use of neural networks in arts has rapidly advanced and has raised both concerns and opportunities. While AI-generated artwork has gained recognition and accolades, it has also sparked fear and uncertainty among traditional artists and creators. However, it is important to recognize that AI is not a replacement for human creativity and artistic expression, but rather a tool that can augment and inspire the artistic process.<br><br>As AI continues to evolve and improve, it is crucial for professionals in the arts to keep up with technological advancements and adapt to the changing landscape. Instead of viewing AI as a threat, it can be seen as an opportunity to push the boundaries of art and explore new possibilities.<br><br>While AI-generated artwork may lack the depth and meaning found in human-generated art, it can offer accessible and affordable options for those seeking aesthetically pleasing pieces. Ultimately, the role of AI in arts should be seen as a complement to human creativity, allowing for the expansion of artistic horizons while preserving the unique and irreplaceable aspects of human expression in the world of arts.</p>
