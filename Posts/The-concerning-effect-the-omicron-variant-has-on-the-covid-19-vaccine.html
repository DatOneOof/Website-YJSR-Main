                        <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>A number of previously conducted studies published in medical journals such as <i>The New England Journal of Medicine</i> and <i>The Lancet</i> have brought to light some problems of the COVID-19 vaccines, such as the waning effectiveness as variants pass. The spike protein of the new variants keeps mutating away from what it was like in the original strain of the virus, which is a concern because the mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) of the vaccine trains the immune system to fight the spike protein of the original variant. When the mRNA first enters the body, it looks to attach itself to the ribosomes in the skin cells. Then, tRNAs, or transfer ribonucleic acids, carrying amino acids to the ribosome site will read the information on the mRNA, and copy it. The amino acids of the tRNAs make a chain. Once the chain is complete, it will fold, making a protein. As the tRNA reads the mRNA, it builds a spike protein that functions like the one on the surface of the COVID-19 virus particle. After the protein is built, it is displayed on the surface of the cell. Since the genetic code of the virus has changed, the body will be unprepared when the new variant enters it.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Substantial Decreases in Effectiveness</h2>
                        <p>A group of researchers compared the effectiveness of the vaccine against different variants on March 16, 2022. The study included the use of a luciferase reporter gene. Luciferase means to produce light when they oxidize, or chemically combine with oxygen, with the reactant. So, when the antibodies were produced, light would show in response. It was found that in comparison to the original virus, the concentration of antibodies was twenty times less in the BA.1 variant. In the BA.2 variant, the concentration was twenty seven times less. Imagine you had a sample of one hundred antibodies. Having twenty times less means there would only be five antibodies left!</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">More Doses Increase the Spread of the Virus</h2>
                        <p>In a study conducted by Danish scientists, individuals infected by the Omicron BA.1 subvariant were tracked using antigen and RT-PCR (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) tests. They divided the study participants into three groups: the unvaccinated, the vaccinated, and the booster vaccinated people. It was concluded that the infection rate among the unvaccinated was 2.19 (95%-CI 1.58-3.04),  2.45 (95%-CI 1.77-3.40) among the fully vaccinated, and 2.99 (95%-CI 2.11-4.24) among the booster vaccinated people. If these were the case results, that would mean the vaccine has become a catalyst for infection.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Why Do More Doses Increase the Spread of the Virus?</h2>
                        <p>When people have certain diseases, doctors often prescribe different types of medications because some small percentage of the antigens can withstand the effects of the medication. For example, Purell claims to kill “99.99% of germs,” meaning that .01 percent of germs can withstand the effect of the hand sanitizer. For this small group of particles, a second medication is prescribed to treat them. In the case of the vaccine, there is no second method of treatment when the variant is first discovered. So, the original strain of virus dies out while the mutated particles live to reproduce. The reason why getting more doses of the vaccine is worse is the antibodies produced under the influence of the vaccine are reacting with the mutated virus particles in a way that allows the virus to reproduce faster.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">What Has Been Done?</h2>
                        <p>Scientists have been trying to stay on top of the Covid variants by modifying the vaccine to fight the variant. A fourth Pfizer booster shot was created to fight the Omicron variant. However, the vaccine only proved to be 30% effective according to <i>The New England Journal of Medicine</i>.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>In countries like the United States, mask mandates are coming down as quickly as covid cases are on the rise. More cases mean more spread, which means more variants. With the virus mutating at a rapid speed, can scientists keep up?</p>
