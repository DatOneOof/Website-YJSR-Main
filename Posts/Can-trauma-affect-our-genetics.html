                        <p>Have you ever heard of Nature vs Nurture? In short, this contentious debate tackles the question as to whether humans’ behaviors and genetics are “pre-wired” by nature or by external factors due to exposure to the environment. Well, research in epigenetics has revealed that both elements play an instrumental role in human behavior!  For years, scientists have been trying to discover what factors influence our genetics, producing many studies that have examined epigenetic changes in children whose parents have faced traumatic experiences. However, upon further investigation, another question is raised: how much of behavioral epigenetics can be passed down generations? In this article, I will attempt to excavate the answer.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">What is epigenetics?</h2>
                        <p>According to Bob Weinhold, a published researcher, epigenetics is a term that can be roughly translated to “changes in genetic sequence” [1]. While our DNA sequences can change through mutations that induce varying effects on our internal functions and overall health, mutations in humans are quite rare. Thus, what allows for varying illnesses and behaviors to occur has been linked to epigenetic changes: factors that influence our gene expression, the way our body reads a DNA sequence without actually changing the DNA code. These changes in expression can be passed down generations. Although epigenetics is a natural process and occasionally favorable for organisms, scientists warn of the environmental factors that can adversely affect our behavior or health [1].</p>
                        <p>There are many types of epigenetic changes that function in different ways. The most prominent ones are DNA methylation, histone modification, and factors within mRNA. In general, they all consist of ways in which chemical groups influence specific regions on DNA directly or via proteins such as histones, thus altering whether a gene is turned on or off.  As humans develop from the womb, our DNA assembles chemical marks that affect how much of our gene is expressed; these chemical marks are known as our epigenomes. Our different experiences can rearrange those chemical marks [2].  Research has proven that our environment, alongside nature, does play a role in altering gene expression.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">What is trauma?</h2>
                        <p>Trauma is an emotional response to a stressful event. Both physical and mental symptoms can occur as a result. Trauma can occur as a result of a singular event, repeated, or long term exposure to stress, or multiple events. Psychological responses vary from anger, denial, fear, depression, shame, confusion, etc [4], while physical responses can range from fatigue, sweating, or a racing heart.</p>
                        <p>Natural disasters, bullying, acts of terrorism, attacks, war, abuse and losses of loved ones all are examples of traumatic experiences. Unfortunately, the prevalence of such traumatic experiences is appallingly high in society. According to Jayne Leonard, a professional psychotherapist and published author of Medical News Today,  “research estimates that 60–75% of people in North America experience a traumatic event at some point” [3].</p>
                        <p>Trauma exists in many forms but the most prominent ones are post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and childhood trauma, both of which have varying effects on people. PTSD ​​symptoms include nightmares, “severe anxiety, flashbacks, and persistent memories of the event” [4]. This response often feeds into other health problems such as depression, suicidal thoughts, substance abuse, and more. On the other hand, childhood trauma places children in a vulnerable state, which is especially detrimental because a child’s brain is still developing. The hormones released due to the high state of stress and fear affect a child's long-term growth physically and mentally.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Can traumatic experiences affect the genetics of our offspring?</h2>
                        <p>Now, let’s answer the question posed earlier on in the article: how much of behavioral genetics is actually hereditary? Before we jump straight in, we have to understand that stressful events act on one's environment. Research now shows that the physical and emotional changes a person experiences in their lifetime due to traumatic events affect gene expression. These epigenetic changes have further been suggested to have had effects on the offspring of those who have experienced trauma.</p>
                        <p>For example, victims of the Holocaust were proven to have epigenetic changes [5]. According to the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs,  “many Holocaust survivors have PTSD and other emotional disorders, and it's well-known that children of traumatized people are at increased risk for PTSD.” As trends have shown that children were more frequently showing signs of depression and anxiety, a team of researchers focused on the FKBP5 gene, which is linked to stress, “PTSD, depression, and mood and anxiety disorders,” [5] to investigate whether the stress parents face could be hereditary. A type of epigenetic change called DNA methylation, where chemical groups attach to specific areas of our DNA, altering whether a certain gene is turned on or off was used to determine if epigenetic changes occur. In regards to victims of the Holocaust, this traumatic exposure did have “an effect on FKBP5 methylation,” [5].</p>
                        <p>For further investigation, a team of researchers supervised by Rachel Yehuda, an Endowed Professor of Psychiatry and Neuroscience of Trauma in the Icahn School of Medicine, used blood samples of Holocaust survivors and their adult children, who lived in Europe, the U.S. or Canada, and compared their results to a control group of Jewish parents and their adult children who lived outside of Europe, the U.S. or Canada, during the Holocaust. Surprisingly, the results showed that survivors had an increase in methylation of about 10 percent. However, the survivors’ children had about 8 percent lower methylation than the children of U.S. or Canadian-born parents [5]. These results suggest that, “children of traumatized parents are not simply born with a PTSD-like biology," according to Dr. John Krystal, a research psychiatrist at the VA Connecticut Healthcare System. Surprisingly, although epigenetic tags on the same part of this stress-linked gene in both the Holocaust survivors and their offspring were found, the same relation was not found in any of the control groups (Thomson) [7]. These studies have created an emerging trend in environmental effects on epigenetics.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, research has shown that out of the 190 adult children of Holocaust survivors, “18.4 percent reported having generalized anxiety disorder in the past year” and “13.7 percent for a major depression episode, and 7.4 percent for PTSD” [5]. These results make sense because the children did not face the same traumatic experience. However, they were most certainly exposed to the aftermath of this trauma through their parents.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>In summary, we can now see that the environment affects epigenetics. Despite the question as to whether stress can be inherited by children still stands, Yehuda’s study has marked the beginning of a complex, molecular understanding of epigenetics and the stress-response system.  While previous studies have claimed that offspring of survivors are more likely to experience stress-like symptoms, we are certain that parental experiences, such as malnutrition and exposure to drugs, have affected offspring. We have also been reaffirmed of the fact that survivors of traumatic events were affected by their environment, which has motivated researchers to continue examining why children of Holocaust survivors tend to have higher rates of stress [6] and how much of it is linked to epigenetic inheritance.</p>
