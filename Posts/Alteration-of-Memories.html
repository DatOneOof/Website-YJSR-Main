                        <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>How would someone feel if they knew that their own memories, whether good or bad, may not be like how they remember. Humans develop their personalities and learn from their past experiences, however, what if the recollection of those experiences was incorrect? For over two millenniums, neuroscientists, physicians, and philosophers have aimed to understand memories as well as how to manipulate them. In modern days, the knowledge about memories has increased in multiple ways including how one can erase, manipulate, and even add memories. With the rapid advancement in technology, yesterday’s science fiction theme of memory alteration is coming to life. Unfortunately, this new discovery might have a lot of negative implications, particularly in the judiciary system. This research aims to point out the different circumstances where memories can be altered and how such an alteration relates to real-life situations.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">What are Memories?</h2>
                        <p>Memory is the brain’s process of collecting, connecting, and creating patterns to enable the organism to embrace the immense amount of information a human receives from birth. There are different types of memories, short-term memories, that last from a span of a few seconds to a few hours, as well as long-term memories that can last for years. Interestingly, common knowledge memories are called declarative or explicit memories, whereas procedural memories, such as skills learned, are non-declarative or implicit memories. Having a memory engraved in one's brain without the ability to retrieve it is fruitless, so the brain has a complex retrieval system (Greshko).</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Different Ways of Memory Alteration</h2>
                        <h3>1. Natural Recollection of Memories</h3>
                        <p>Any post-event information (facts, ideas, suggestions) may lead to memory modification. Whenever someone recalls or narrates an event, their brain network alters small bits of information depending on their audiences’ reaction. When one recalls the same experience, the brain has already erased the original occurrence and remembers the updated version it recalled the previous time. Even the most revolutionary brain scans are unable to distinguish the difference (We Change Our Memories Each Time We Recall Them). Unsurprisingly, memories are associated with the telephone game, in which a phrase is transmitted by players via whispering, and by the time the last player's turn comes around, the word has changed (Your Memory Is like the Telephone Game).</p>
                        <p>Through the years, several variations of study reports have been carried out on groups of persons ranging from 70 to 200 individuals. The results show that almost all participants involved had some sort of memory alteration. Those distortions are caused by the brain’s constant adaptations, and its incapability to store every detail (We Change Our Memories Each Time We Recall Them).</p>
                        <h3>2. In Response to Trauma</h3>
                        <p>Trauma, whether physical or psychological, has the ability to impact a person's formation and recollection of memories. Victims of traumatic events typically have a vivid remembrance of the main event, and yet,  the peripheral details (location, date, and the perpetrator) may not be well retained in the memory or recalled accurately. Factually, people who have experienced trauma will inevitably experience ruminations and involuntary thoughts and images. This will in turn further alter those unstable peripheral memories (Less Important Details May Not Be Remembered Well).</p>
                        <h3>3. Manipulation by People</h3>
                        <p>Conversations can be one of the causes of memory alteration due to human interactions. Manipulation, whether intended or not, is one of the most common ways memories are altered. The first form of manipulation is the "collaborative inhibition" phenomenon, which happens when a group of people collectively recall an incident. Even though it may seem that people in a group activate each other's memories, this is not the case. Research proved that although the group may record more together, each individual’s memories will be impaired. The second way people might alter each other’s memories through manipulation is known as “socially-shared retrieval-induced forgetting”. This method is based on the fact that each time one reactivates a certain memory, it becomes increasingly fragile and malleable. This occurs by starting a conversation that might trigger one’s memory, talking about one main idea but failing to mention another occurrence. The memory might still be inscribed in one’s brain but its suppression to focus on the other point will cause alteration and make it harder to remember in the future. Lastly, humans might manipulate memories by implanting doubts and infectious thoughts into the other person’s brain (Four Ways That Other People Can Warp Your Memory).</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Memory Altering in Real Life</h2>
                        <h3>1. In the Judiciary System</h3>
                        <p>The global justice system is based evenly on the memories of the victim or witness and on the substantial physical evidence received. Due to memory’s importance in serving as evidence in legal proceedings, the judiciary system placed an unlimited number of limitations on its usage. Unfortunately, 75% of 235 wrongful convictions in the US were a result of an unreliable eyewitness. This is a result of an individual stating a previously altered memory instead of a veridical representation of factual events. The memories of such victims/witnesses can be skewed in a variety of ways, including conversations with other biased people who witnessed the incident, or as a result of media coverage. Unfortunately, memory alterations that cause an incorrect statement might also be caused by professionals in the field of crime or psychology. One might be manipulated while being interrogated by an investigator who is certain about their hypothesis. Additionally, one might go to therapy due to mental health reasons, and this may lead to a therapist’s diagnosis which can convince the patient that an unfortunate situation in their past is the cause of their current condition. In all the above-listed cases, trials and litigation are conducted resulting in unjust imprisonments (Speaking of Psychology).</p>
                        <h3>2. To Cure Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</h3>
                        <p>Fortunately, not all usages of memory alteration are harmful and manipulative. Modern research has found ways to help people with anxiety, phobias, and PTSD. Blocking a chemical called norepinephrine - which is involved in the fight or flight response and is responsible for triggering symptoms such as sweaty palms and a racing heart, will in turn moderate traumatic memories and terminate their association with negativity. Recently, scientists have utilized a drug called propranolol - a norepinephrine blocker- to eradicate the fear of spiders from arachnophobes. The purpose of using norepinephrine blockers might not be to delete those painful memories, but simply to alter them in an attempt to be less painful (MacDonald).</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>For centuries scientists and philosophers believed that memories were stored permanently in the brain. This hypothesis has been proven false alongside the usage of modern technologies. Research has proved that memories can become distorted through multiple factors like manipulation by society (people or media), physical or mental trauma, and natural post-event experiences. Knowing how memories form a person's personality and experiences is both thrilling and terrifying. Thrilling in the sense that this breakthrough has the potential to unlock new ways to reinforce memories and prevent them from being abused, as well as cure PTSD and other disorders. On the other hand, it could be extremely frightening in a variety of sectors, especially the judiciary system because of its reliance on memories and people's convictions.</p>
                        <p>Using modern technology would inevitably lead to the acquisition of scientific knowledge about memory modification processes and consequences, and answers to the questions that neuroscientists, doctors, and philosophers have been asking for millennia.</p>
