            <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              The concept of parallel universes has an initial impression of
              nonsense when put into the face of science however one may be
              surprised yet intrigued to realise there is a theory in physics
              which supports this very idea. This idea comes beneath a branch in
              physics commonly named as Quantum Mechanics. Quantum mechanics is
              the study of particle behaviour on a miniscule level,
              experimenting with the eccentricities of electrons or accepting
              certain uncertainties which we have not come across before.
            </p>
            <p>
              Famous figures in this field of study include but are not limited
              to Niels Bohr, known for his studies on atomic energy levels,
              Albert Einstein for his discoveries of the particle nature of
              light, now known as photons, Louis De Broglie for his insights
              into matter waves, commonly known as the De Broglie wavelength and
              finally, Erwin Schrodinger. The topic I will explore in this
              article is an evolving one which has slowly gained appreciation
              within the physics community, following from initial hesitation
              due to the science fiction connotations of this concept.
              Physicists have come a long way to arrive at this theory,
              beginning with Niels Bohr and his energy levels. The significance
              of this theory is demonstrated by the manner in which it can
              change our perception on daily life events as well as accelerate
              the developments and uses of advanced technology.
            </p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">
              A brief introduction to quantum mechanics
            </h2>
            <p>
              A key idea I’ll establish early on is the significance of
              observation in this field. This will be explored later on but
              we’ll first begin with Niels Bohr. In an atom, there are discrete
              energy levels. Using the knowledge of electrons within the atom,
              we can establish that electrons can jump between these energy
              levels if a photon with exactly the right amount of energy is
              absorbed. This is essential as photons and electrons have a
              one-to-one interaction. Following the advancements in the particle
              nature of light, demonstrated by Albert Einstein using the
              photoelectric effect, discussions began to arise on whether an
              electron could display wave-like properties. Key properties of
              waves include diffraction and interference. Diffraction is the
              spreading out of waves after passing through a boundary. There are
              two types of interference: constructive and destructive.
              Constructive interference occurs when two waves in phase produce a
              singular wave which has an amplitude resulting from the two waves.
              In other words, the amplitude of the two waves will be added to
              produce the resultant amplitude. Destructive interference occurs
              when two waves out of phase interfere however cancel out. To
              showcase these properties, an electron diffraction experiment took
              place. To physicists’ surprise, on a screen, fluorescent rings had
              been produced. The bright rings represented constructive
              interference and the grey areas displayed destructive interference
              which showed that electrons are both particles and waves.

            <h2 class="section-heading">Electrons</h2>
            <p>
              Following from the previous section, we know that electrons are
              classed as both particles and waves. To further this concept,
              we’ll introduce a scientist named Louis De Broglie. De Broglie
              plays a part in the wave-particle duality of these electrons,
              deriving the idea that the wavelength of these particles is
              inversely proportional to its momentum. It was established earlier
              that electrons ‘orbit’ the nucleus in discrete energy levels. Why
              does this occur?<br /><br />
              E = hf <br /><br />
              The frequency, f, can be substituted using the equation f = c / λ,
              producing the equation E = hc / λ <br />
              <br />Energy is inversely proportional to the wavelength. Since
              electrons display wave-like properties, they must also consist of
              a wavelength. Following on from this, these energy levels consist
              of a whole number of wavelengths which allows for the discrete and
              exact nature of these energy levels. [3] <br /><br />
              As any theory in physics, or science, this must be tested.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Young’s Double Slit</h2>
            <p>
              When venturing into the wave nature of light, a famous experiment
              was done by Thomas Young, named as Young’s Double Slit. This
              involves a screen, a singular slit and a double slit. Light is
              shone through the single slit to ensure a coherent source of light
              and is then passed through the double slit to produce patterns
              called ‘fringes’ on the screen. These fringes consist of dark and
              light patterns, the dark showing destructive interference and the
              light showing constructive interference.
            </p>
            <p>
              A similar concept was later used for electrons however a
              peculiarity emerged. The electrons behave as particles when
              observed, e.g. passing through one slit but when unobserved, show
              diffraction patterns. In this scenario, the observer per say is
              the detector. This gave way to the concept of a wave function. [6]
            </p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">The Copenhagen Interpretation</h2>
            <p>
              Following on, a wave function is a mathematical function which is
              spread out in space and demonstrates the probability of a particle
              being anywhere within that space. It is denoted by the Greek
              letter psi. This is known as a superposition of every position
              this particle may be in. The value of the wave function at any of
              these points is the amplitude. To find the probability, we square
              this value in order to maintain a positive probability.
            </p>
            <p>
              The famous Schrodinger equation can provide the wave function of a
              quantum mechanical system and therefore predicts the behaviour of
              a dynamic system.
            </p>
            <p>
              This equation replaced Newton’s Laws in the quantum world as his
              equations such as F=ma did not work with the size of the particles
              in the quantum world. For example, if a particle is put into a box
              and we want to inquire its position, F=ma would not work.
              Furthermore, Heisenberg’s Uncertainty principle states that we
              cannot know a particle’s exact position and exact momentum of
              quantum objects.
            </p>
            <img

            <p class="img-cap">Figure 2: Copenhagen Interpretation</p>
            <p>
              The equation tells us what energy levels the electron is allowed
              to have. If an electron was inside a box, there is zero
              probability of it being outside the box, therefore the wave
              function outside the box is zero. Since the wave function is a
              wave, it has a frequency and we know E = hf. Therefore, electrons
              can only occupy certain energy levels. [5]
            </p>
            <p>
              As experimentally noted, an electron displays varying behaviour
              dependent on the presence of an observer. When we observe its
              particle nature, we observe it going through one of the double
              slits. At the time, this eccentric phenomena was seen due to the
              collapse of the wave function. As I previously mentioned, a wave
              function extends through all of space but when observed, this wave
              function collapses instantly into the measured outcome. [4]
            </p>
            <p>
              Using a well-known thought experiment, this idea can be
              demonstrated. This thought experiment was derived by Erwin
              Schrodinger.
            </p>
            <p>
              The experiment goes as follows: <br /><br />There is a cat in an
              opaque box which contains radioactive material. Radioactive
              materials can decay at any moment as it is a completely random
              process. If the material decays, this will kill the cat. Unless we
              open this box, we don’t know whether the cat is dead or alive.
              This insinuates that the cat is in a state of superposition,
              meaning that it is both dead and alive until we open the box.
              According to the Copenhagen Interpretation, once we open the box,
              the wave function collapses to give us either a dead or alive cat.
              In the electron experiment, as soon as the electron was observed,
              the wave function collapsed to show us its particle nature.
              Although logically this seems feasible, theoretical exploration

            <h2 class="section-heading">The Many Worlds Interpretation</h2>
            <p>
              So far, we have established that upon observation, the wave
              function collapses to give us the measured outcome. A measurement
              in the thought experiment would be a process which would entangle
              the state of the observer and the cat, e.g. opening the box.
              According to the Copenhagen Interpretation, only a singular
              possibility becomes aware to us that is either of a dead or alive
              cat.
            </p>

            <p>
              What if we were to consider the wave function not collapsing at
              all? If this were the case, instead of the alternate possibility
              disappearing, as the observer is now entangled with the cat, there
              is a superposition between the observer seeing an alive cat and
              the observer seeing a dead cat. This shows us slowly evolving into
              a state of superposition, leading to the Many Worlds
              Interpretation. [4]
            </p>
            <p>
              This interpretation is known as the purest form of quantum
              mechanics as it is completely deterministic and directly follows
              from the Schrodinger Equation. If a system becomes entangled, the
              different outcomes have no effect on each other, introducing the
              concept of the many worlds. This was established by a graduate
              from Princeton in the 1950s named Hugh Everett.
            </p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              In my judgement, I believe that the Many Worlds Interpretation has
              a high likelihood of being an accurate description of our
              universe; however, like any theory, this does have objections.
              Some may object by questioning how a classical world emerges if
              everything is quantum and in the near future, I wish to explore
              this.
