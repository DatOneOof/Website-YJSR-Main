                        <h2 class="section-heading">Abstract</h2>
                        <p>Semiconductors have driven the growth and development of the entire world. They are substances which have the perfect magnitude of electrical conductivity to create microchips used in electronic devices. Now that we live in the digital age, we are surrounded by semiconductors, whether it is in the form of smartphones, laptops or cars. Such an integral part of human life is bound to have implications on global policy and economy. Especially because, like every other valuable commodity, it is limited and the world has recently been battling a chip shortage. The industry of semiconductors operates through a global value chain network, wherein multiple regions contribute in the development, manufacturing and distribution of chips. Semiconductors have made the world more interconnected and economically stronger. On the other hand, their scarcity has aggravated inﬂation and proved disastrous to manufacturing industries. Nations try to gain control of the semiconductor industry for their advantage, which poses a threat to international security. This has been observed in the tussle between China and Taiwan, where China is trying to get uniﬁed with the neighbouring country, signiﬁcantly because it is the world's largest semiconductor manufacturer. If a war were to break out between these two nations, it would have grave repercussions for the entire world. Therefore, it is imperative to study how the semiconductor industry impacts the world because of its pertinence over each of our lives. This article delves into these impacts and determines how the semiconductor industry is interrelated to geographical politics as well as the global economy.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>Semiconductors  are  a  revolution  in  technological  advancement  and  a  pillar  for  both  geopolitical power  and  economic  aﬄuence.  They  are  the  building  blocks  of  all  electronic devices. Used in the form  of  microchips,  semiconductors  are  those  substances  that  conduct  electricity  under  special circumstances, like an adequate amount of heat or a magnetic ﬁeld. Their conductivity lies between a conductor  and  an  insulator,  making  them  perfect  for  managing  and  controlling  electric  current  in electronic devices. Some examples of semiconductors are silicon, germanium, carbon, arsenic, etc.</p>
                        <p>These  nano-sized  silicon  chips  are powerful components that serve as the backbone of our modern technological ﬁelds, enabling the functioning of countless electronic devices and driving innovation across industries like Information & Technology, health, ﬁnance, automobiles, and defence. Whether it  is  smartphones,  computers,  televisions,  cars,  medical  devices, military equipment, or an array of other  essential  technologies  that  shape  our  daily  lives,  semiconductors  are  omnipresent.    As  the global   demand   for   advanced   electronics   continues   to   surge,   the   network   of   semiconductor manufacturing and distribution, also known as the supply chain, has been expanding.</p>
                        <p>The    current    geopolitical    scene    is    permeated    by    volatility,   conﬂict,   and   uncertainty.   The Russia-Ukraine   war   has   further   strained   a   multitude   of   international   relationships.   Since  all industries  across  the  world  use  electronic  devices  that  use  semiconductors,  microchips  navigate throughout  the  globe.  The  Nation  that  establishes  dominion  over  chips  shall  end  up  having  an inordinate  strategic  advantage  over  other  countries,  which  it  can  use  for  the  exploitation of others and personal gain. Thus, the semiconductor industry has a critical role in this scenario.  The world is facing  a  distressing  semiconductor  shortage  which,  if  not  dealt  with  sensitively,  may  propel  the world to the brink of war.</p>
                        <p>This also poses a threat to the world economy, which is facing a slowdown. A recession is looming, and  the  world  is  still dealing with the remnants of the COVID-19 pandemic. In light of the current situation,  the  rising  demand  and  the  simultaneous  shortage  of microchips can prove detrimental to the global economy. Due to the dependency of a massive number of industries on the semiconductor industry,  it  is  pivotal  to  the  global  economy  and  world  trade.  Even  though  semiconductors  by themselves constitute a small portion of world trade and GDP, they form an imperative component of commodities  and  processes  worth  trillions  of  dollars.    Thus,  disruptions  in  the  semiconductor industry  can  seep  into  other  sectors  and  exacerbate  the  situation  by  reducing  productivity  and increasing unemployment. It is, therefore, important that the semiconductor industry stays sturdy for a steady economic ecosystem.</p>
                        <p>Semiconductors  have  a  vital  role  in  ensuring  the  economic  and  geopolitical  stability of the world. Therefore,  this  shortage  should  be  dealt  with  innovatively  and  sustainably.  To  achieve  this,  the products  need  to  be  redesigned,  research  and  development  need  to  be  expedited,  and  the  supply chain needs to become streamlined and balanced. It is vital for everyone to be aware of the relevance of semiconductors to the world, the economy, and all of our lives. Semiconductors may be a threat, but it is an even greater opportunity to shape the world in the right manner and ensure the welfare as well as the progress of the entire world. Thus, it is rightly said that semiconductors are the oil of the new world.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Geopolitical Impact</h2>
                        <p>Since  the  latter  half  of  the  20th  century,  semiconductors  have  acted  as  a  link  between  all nations. Every country needs microchips to drive its technological growth and development. Thus, it plays a decisive role in the sculpting of foreign policies and international relations. The fact that only a few nations hold a monopoly over the production of quality chips gives rise to a plethora of geopolitical implications. Any geographical shift in technological manufacturing leads directly to a shift in power dynamics.  This  is  the  reason  why Europe dominated the world in the 19th century, America in the 20th,  and  now  Asia  is  emerging  as  the  new  nucleus  of  power.  It  can,  thus,  be  construed  that semiconductors have impacted geopolitics in more ways than one.</p>
                        <h3>Interconnected World and Global Interaction</h3>
                        <p>Semiconductors      have     accelerated     globalisation     by     increasing     interconnectedness     and interdependence    among    countries    and    economies.    Microchips    have    enhanced    worldwide communication,  transportation  and  trade  links  through  the advancement of technology. Apart from this, they interlinked the world as a consequence of their diversiﬁed supply chains. The raw material for  chips  comes  from  a  particular  region,  the manufacturing  takes  place  in  another  region  and they are shipped to a diﬀerent region, on the basis of  specialisation  and  demand.  Cognizant  of  this, semiconductor-producing  companies  have  been crossing  national  borders  for  each  supply  chain activity.  Not  only  has  this  paved  the  way  for  a more  globalised  world,  but  it  has  also  boosted global   trade   as   a   result   of   better  access  and dispersion of microchips, which contribute to the development  of  other  commodities.  The  growth charts  of  the  Sales  Revenue  of  semiconductors (Fig.1)1   and  of  the  Total  Global Exports (Fig.2)2 are   in   congruence   with   each   other.   It   can, therefore,  be  construed  that  with  the  advent  of semiconductors,   the   world   has   become   more interconnected and interdependent.</p>

                        <h3>Global Chip Shortage and its Implications</h3>
                        <p>The  recent  developments  in  the  post-COVID  world  ensued  an  acute  shortage  of  semiconductors. Millions  of  workers  became  homebound,  impeding  the  production  of  microchips.  Moreover,  the Russia-Ukraine war and the Taiwan droughts of 2021 disturbed the supply chain. On the other hand, the demand for electronic devices surged in an unprecedented manner due to a multitude of reasons like  work-from-home  and  the  requirement  of  data-mining  machines  for  cryptocurrency.  Personal computers  alone saw a 13% hike in global demand. This situation came to be known as the Global Semiconductor Crisis or ‘Chipageddon’.</p>
                        <p>Such a situation can have serious consequences on geopolitical harmony. It will escalate geopolitical competition  among  countries  for  the  control  of  the  semiconductor  industry  so that they can shield themselves  from  the  crisis  and  leverage  the  shortage  by  monopolising  the  industry  and  exports  in order  to  exert  supremacy.  A  good  example  of  this  is  pressurisation  on  the  Taiwan  Semiconductor Manufacturing  Company  (TSMC)  by  the  United  States  to  stop  supplying  chips  to  the  Chinese company Huawei, due to the tensions between the two nations.</p>
                        <h3>The Value Chain and its Signiﬁcance</h3>
                        <p>A  value  chain  or  a  supply  chain  refers  to  the  intricate  network  of  all  the  processes  and  stages involved  in  the  production  and  distribution  of  semiconductor  devices  and  chips.  The  world  has become  an  interconnected  economy,  and  the  value  chain  has had a signiﬁcant role in it. The value chain of semiconductors is intricate, interconnected as well as dispersed globally. It entails research and  development,  design  and  manufacturing  of  microchips. Diﬀerent nations specialise in diﬀerent areas.  Countries  like  India, Israel, Singapore, Germany, South Korea, and the UK have become the vanguards of semiconductor R&D. Canada, European nations, and the United States lead the world in  design.  At  the  forefront  of  manufacturing,  assembling,  testing,  and  supply  of  raw  materials are countries  like  Taiwan, China, Malaysia, Japan, and other Asian nations. It is, therefore, vital for all countries  to  collaborate  to  utilise  the  expertise  of  every  geographical  region  for  the  beneﬁt  of  the entire Earth. The synergy between the diﬀerent global semiconductor industries is massive. In fact, it is postulated that the semiconductor crisis aggravated as an outcome of the ripple eﬀect generated by the March 2021 ﬁre at a Tokyo factory of Renesas Electronics, a company that controls 35% of the automotive semiconductor market.</p>
                        <h3>Chip Wars: Why are Chips a cause of Conﬂict between Nations?</h3>
                        <p>Japan imposed export restrictions on South Korea in 2019 due to a diplomatic conﬂict. Since South Korean  companies sorely needed raw materials from Japan for chip production. Thus, Japan had to ease   the   restrictions   in   2020.   However,   semiconductors   do   not   always  resolve  conﬂicts.  As mentioned  earlier,  countries  like  to  assert  dominance  over  others  and  breach  the  value  chain  to emerge  self-suﬃcient.  This  leads  to  a  situation  known  as  chip  wars,  wherein  nations  formulate policies, impose sanctions and take actions that undermine the position of other nations in the global value chain. The ongoing US-China Conﬂict is the quintessential example of a chip war. The United States  has  imposed  trade  restrictions  on  Chinese  companies.  In  retaliation,  China  has  expelled foreign vendors from its domestic markets and given exclusivity to Chinese ﬁrms in the regulation of manufacturing.   India   is   also   planning   to   combat   and   emerge  as  an  alternative  to  China  by announcing a $10 billion incentive plan to amplify semiconductor manufacturing.</p>
                        <h3>Boon and Bane for National Security</h3>
                        <p>National  security  in  today’s  day  and  age  is  a  very  broad  concept;  it  encompasses human security, military  security,  economic  security,  environment  security,  food  security  and  information  security. Semiconductors  have  been  helpful  in  all  these  domains  because  of  their  usage in missile systems, surveillance, secure communication, modernisation of agriculture and boosting items of export. Due to  the  interconnected  technological  advancements  brought about by semiconductors in all domains of  national  security,  nations  have  experienced  prosperity,  well-being,  and  improvements  in overall health and welfare.</p>
                        <p>There is, however, a drawback to interconnected economies, value chains can be tampered with, and the  supply  of  semiconductors  can  be  distorted  by  any  nation with undue dominance. This will not only disrupt other industrial processes but also deprive nations of exploiting vital know-hows, which are  diﬃcult  to  import—for  example,  quality  chip  production,  R&D,  management  techniques,  et cetera. Thus, there might arise a global crisis, which can potentially lead to war-like situations. Apart from  this,  counterfeit  versions of chips may exist and carry viruses or malware that can undermine the security of a nation. Another example of a threat is the integration of semiconductor technology in  mechanised  and  AI-based  warfare, which can be more lethal than the contemporary practices of warfare. Therefore, the impact of semiconductors on the security of a nation is lopsided.</p>

                        <p>Semiconductors are estimated to have a trillion-dollar market by 2030, currently standing at $580.13 billion in 2022.   Semiconductors do not constitute a large portion of the global GDP; however, it has doubled  from  0.25%  of  the  GDP  three  decades ago to 0.50% in 2021. The role of semiconductors can  be  understood  with  the  examples  of  countries  like  Taiwan  and  the  US.  Taiwan,  also  often referred   to   as   the   "Silicon   Valley   of   Asia,"   has   the   most   dominant  presence  in  the  global semiconductor  market.  The  semiconductor  industry  has  played  a  humongous  role  in  Taiwan’s economy  and  growth.  A  renowned  Taiwanese  company,  Taiwan  Semiconductor  Manufacturing Company  (TSMC),  has  become  a  big  player  in  semiconductor  manufacturing,  supplying  chips  to major  technology  companies  globally.  Taiwan's  strong  semiconductor  industry  has  also  attracted foreign  investment  providing  it  with  building  a  better supply chain and strengthening its economy. Similarly, in the United States, the semiconductor industry has played a key role in economic growth and  innovation.  It  has been a signiﬁcant contributor to the GDP and employment. Additionally, the export of semiconductors has contributed to a positive trade balance for the United States, supporting its position as a global technology leader.</p>
                        <h3>Shortage of Semiconductors as a Cause of Inﬂation</h3>
                        <p>The emergence of the semiconductor industry has had an intense economic impact, particularly with regard  to  the  inﬂationary  eﬀects  on the      automobile      and      electronics sectors. About 25% of manufacturing industries  depend  on  semiconductors directly  for  their  inputs. The surge in demand and the global semiconductor shortage    caused    a    supply-demand imbalance  and  triggered  inﬂationary pressures within these industries. The industries       heavily       reliant       on semiconductors  have  faced  inﬂation at   a   higher   rate,   as   indicated   by Fig.33.    Moreover,    the    electronics sector has also been severely impacted, with prices of electronic devices, including smartphones and laptops,  experiencing  an upward trajectory due to the shortage of semiconductors. This inﬂationary trend  has  resulted  in  reduced  aﬀordability  for  consumers  and  hindered  the  growth potential of the electronics industry.</p>

                        <h3>Automobile Industry</h3>
                        <p>The  automobile  industry  was  one  of  the  most  aﬀected  industries  by  the semiconductor crisis. The shortage  of  semiconductors  rattled  the production of automobile manufacturers, leading to reduced manufacturing  and  increased  prices  of  vehicles,  thereby  aﬀecting  consumer  purchasing power and bounding  the  growth  of  the  automobile  industry.  The  prices  of  cars  rose  about  20%  worldwide annually, since the commencement of the shortage. Car manufacturers have had to cut an estimated 19.6  million  vehicles  out  of  their  production  schedules  between  2021  and  2023.  In  2021,  the automotive industry lost approximately $200 billion of revenue due to the aforementioned crisis. In the same year, India recorded the lowest levels of automobile sales in the proceeding ten years.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">China-Taiwan Conﬂict: Case-study Analysis</h2>
                        <h3>Overview of Cross-Strait Relations</h3>
                        <p>The diplomatic relations between China and Taiwan are known as the Cross-Strait Relations. Taiwan is an island nation located in the South China Sea and it has an independent governance of its own. However,  the  People's  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  claims  that  it  is  a  part  of  the  PRC because of its historic  and  ethnic  ties.  A  central  role  in  China's calls for a "national reuniﬁcation" is the fact that Taiwan   is   the   largest   manufacturer   of   semiconductors.   It   produces  60  per  cent  of  the  total semiconductors  and  90  per  cent  of the most advanced ones. Thus, dominion over Taiwan will give China  a  colossal  strategic  advantage.  Both  India  and  the  USA  do  not  oﬃcially  recognise  Taiwan, however,  most  nations  maintain  informal  ties  because  of  its  strategic  importance.  According  to Taiwan's  President  Tsai  Ing-wen,  the  Taiwanese  chip  industry  is  a  "silicon  shield"  that  protects  it from "authoritative regimes" trying to sabotage the supply chain.</p>
                        <h3>In case of a war or blockade</h3>
                        <p>Taiwan is a vital link in the global value chain and any threat to its sovereignty, in the words of UK’s foreign   secretary   James   Cleverly,   shall   mean   that   “no   country   could   shield   itself   from   the repercussions of a war in Taiwan”. Invasion of the island nation will be catastrophic to its successful democracy  and  the  human  rights  of  its  people.  The  Taiwanese  semiconductor  manufacturing industry  having  a  net  worth  of  $521.93B  shall  become  endangered.  About  50%  of  the  world’s container  ships  pass  through  the  Taiwan  Strait.  This  implies  that  a  war  or  blockade  on  this  strait would cripple $2.6 trillion worth of world trade. Therefore, this conﬂict will elicit interventions from all of the major economies of the world. Such a situation can have more grave repercussions on the world economy and will set the economy back 20 years.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>Semiconductor  microchips  changed  the  world  as  we  knew  it.  It  is  the  catalyst  that  has  driven  the overall  technological  advancement  of  the  world.  From  defence  and  agriculture to automobiles and smartphones,  microchips  are  used  everywhere  and  touch  our  lives  every  day.  The  entire  world collaborates  to  leverage  every  region’s  strength  to  produce  and  distribute  quality  semiconductor chips,   creating   an   intricate   value   chain.   This   has   made  our  world  more  interconnected  and globalised. As a consequence of this, the geopolitical environment is also aﬀected. Countries interact with  each  other  in  a  manner  that  grants  them  some  inﬂuence  over  the  global  value  chain.  The Semiconductor Crisis of 2021 also has signiﬁcant geopolitical ramiﬁcations like international conﬂict and  threats  to  the  security  of  nations.  Apart  from  geopolitics,  semiconductors  have  also  had  huge impacts  on  the  global  economy,  be  it  improved  trade  or  inﬂation  and  production  deﬁcit  as  a consequence  of  chip  shortage.  Semiconductors  also  play  an  integral  role  in  international  disputes. The chip industry of Taiwan is a determinant in China’s insistence on their uniﬁcation. This may lead to a tussle on the Taiwanese Strait, that can disturb the semiconductor industry and give rise to grave repercussions to the world. Thus, semiconductors have a pivotal role in the tale of our century. The impact of microchips is massive, cohesive and pervasive. It has the capability of stirring up havoc in our world as well as opening avenues for a new age of intelligence, what matters is how the human race decides to use it.</p>
