                        <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>Bacteria and virus breachings of the outer protective layer of human skin occur daily. Although their microscopic size renders the invasions unnoticeable to the naked eye, these microorganisms often enter the human body through the mouth, nose, eyes, scratches, or open wounds that provide direct access to the bloodstream. Upon coming into contact with a medium which enables pathogens to enter the bloodstream, pathogens begin to colonize host cells, evade immune systems and its responses, replicate itself, and finally fully suppress the immune system. Similarly, like their breaching of skin, the methods to which bacteria and viruses take over their host cells and avoid efforts to eliminate them from immune systems remain invisible to humans. In both cases, a sort of “opening” is needed, where wounds and orifices act as the opening in initial invasions and where glycans and glycan receptors act as the opening during colonization. Lectins on pathogens bind with glycans on the surface of host cells, and pili and afimbrial adhesins enable interaction with host cells. Pathogens also employ a variety of techniques such as adorning polysaccharide capsules and executing molecular mimicry to elude termination by phagocytes issued by the immune system.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">PATHOGEN INTERACTIONS WITH HOST CELLS</h2>
                        <p>All microorganisms produce glycans, which are single-molecule sugars connected by chemical bonds to form a chain-like structure, otherwise known as carbohydrates or polysaccharides. They are crucial in forming structures, storing energy, and regulating systems within a cell. With their existence on the outer surface of plant and animal cells, glycans and their corresponding glycan binding receptors, interactions between pathogens and host cells are deeply influenced.</p>
                        <p>As they generally invade host cells, pathogens utilize their adherence factors (or adhesin) lectins that link directly to cell-surface carbohydrates. These surface-level lectins are commonly found as pili or fimbriae, which are thread-like and hair-like protein subunits respectively that recognize corresponding glycans or carbohydrates and bind to them. These carbohydrates include glycoproteins and glycosphingolipids, which are both found in the cell membrane and play pivotal roles in structuring, mitosis, cell interactions, and initiating immune system responses following their interactions with pathogen lectins. After binding, adhered-carbohydrates are known as adhesion receptors.</p>
                        <p>Pathogen and host cell interactions vary depending on adhesin-receptor pairs as the two are the main factors through which the interactions take place. Thus, certain adhesin-receptor pairs determine the location where pathogens infect such as the skin or the respiratory system.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">PATHOGEN EVASION OF IMMUNE SYSTEM RESPONSES</h2>
                        <p>Adaptation to immune system responses after host cell takeover enabled pathogens to survive longer and replicate itself without suspicion. Even though their protective capsules are much more complex than their method of molecular mimicry, defenses like these are used to prolong the lifespan of pathogens.</p>
                        <p>In order to understand why pathogens employ polysaccharide capsules and the important role it plays in keeping pathogens alive, we first need to look at the way the immune system deals with the intruders. Through a process called opsonization where pathogens are marked with antibodies or complement proteins, phagocytes, a type of white blood cell, recognize the signals and bind to the pathogens before engulfing and killing them. This is an extremely effective way to deal with bacteria and viruses without risking potential escape or replication.</p>
                        <p>However, all pathogens share a common trait of a polysaccharide capsule that makes up the outermost layer of its body. These polysaccharide capsules block possible binding sites for antibodies and complement proteins that will be recognized by phagocytes, preventing the white blood cells from finding and killing the pathogens. Polysacchride capsules also vary depending on the strain of bacteria and virus. This variation makes it difficult for a single binding-antibody to attach to every strain since the outermost layer is different for all of them, thus requiring a prolonged process to eliminate pathogens and giving time for them to replicate and spread. For example, haemophilus influenza that causes meningitis has six different capsules while streptococcus pneumoniae that causes middle-ear infections has more than 90 different capsules.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, pathogens of different strains but similar families often exchange their polysaccharide capsule genes in order to gain more protection against phagocytes. For instance, bacteria in biofilms stick together to surfaces as a thin film and communicate with each other through signaling molecules. Through this, they exchange genes to increase their chances of survival. This exchange thus creates a completely new polysaccharide capsule that further delays proper phagocyte responses.</p>
