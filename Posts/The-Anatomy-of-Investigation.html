            <p>
              Over time, our understanding of how to investigate crime has
              widely advanced over several centuries. In modern times, it takes
              a whole team of individuals to precisely piece together a
              labyrinth of clues to bring justice to a prevailing crime.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the most important parts of a criminal investigation is
              body evidence. Even the smallest piece of evidence deriving from
              victims or criminals can unravel a whole yarn ball of attestation
              in a criminal case. And turns out, there's a significant string
              between knowing the anatomy of the human body and resolving the
              intricacies of a criminal case.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many components of the human body are significant, the blood in
              our veins and arteries, the unique indentations on the tips of our
              fingers, or traces of the hair on our head. Our body plays an
              immense role in a crime, more than we know it. Because of this,
              crime lab scientists have developed numerous methods specifically
              for evidence that derives from human anatomy.
            </p>
            <p>
              The hard structured frame of our body, the skeletal system. The
              skeletal frame of someone serves as a frame for forensic
              scientists. Our skeletal system is unique to us, and is shaped by
              many things including, genetics, lifestyle, and environment. A
              skeletal frame can help establish the profile of the victim.
              Another form of analyzing the bones and skeletal formation is the
              trauma that it was subjected to. The indentation, or indentations,
              of the skeletal structure could be a substantial giveaway to what
              exact weapon was used to harm the victim.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another common component when discovering evidence with anatomy is
              the crimson streams that flow all throughout our body. Blood can
              be widely used as physical evidence of a crime taking place in a
              certain spot; in the forms of splatters, pools, stains on
              clothing, etc. Moreover, with the advanced technology that we have
              developed over the years, we can now match certain blood types to
              the one found at the crime scene. These types of DNA profilings
              have revolutionized criminal investigation, either to narrow down
              suspects or to prove a suspect guilty with the certitude of
              science.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lastly, the time of death concerning a deceased victim is a key
              aspect to framing exactly when the crime occurred. Luckily, the
              human body has several biochemical, anatomical, and physical
              indicators of when exactly the crime has taken place. The three
              mortises, for example; rigor mortis, livor mortis, and algor
              mortis are all post-mortem changes identifiable by a forensic
              pathologist. They are all innate causes that happen entirely
              because of the nature of the human body itself.
            </p>
            <p>
              Rigor mortis is the stiffening of muscles caused by a drop in
              adenosine triphosphate (ATP) which plays a role in muscle
              relaxation. It usually starts small, and as time passes spreads
              throughout the entire body. By analyzing the degree of rigor
              mortis, it can be a sign of the onset of the depletion of ATP.
              Livor mortis is when the blood sets due to gravitational forces in
              the body. In livor mortis, blood tends to pool in usually
              resistant areas, causing the skin to have a purple hue. Like rigor
              mortis, the level of hue of someone's skin in certain areas can be
              an index into how long someone has been lamented. And finally,
              algor mortis is when the body undergoes a change in temperature.
              After an individual dies, the body no longer has ways of cooling
              itself or producing bodily heat, so it regulates to about room
              temperature.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once again, our body is important for a multitude of things in
              everyday life, both for ourselves and others. In the case of
              crime, it is important to use every last bit of evidence to bring
              justice to a victim, and their loved ones. And you will find, the
              human bodies and all its complexity is useful for bridging a gap
              between science, and finding justice.
