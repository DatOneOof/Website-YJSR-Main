                            <h2>Four Fundamental Forces</h2>
                            <p>Forces within the universe help keep atoms intact and planets in their orbit. They play an important role in the functioning of the natural world. There are four main forces: gravity, electromagnetism, strong nuclear forces, and weak nuclear forces. </p>
                            <p>Gravitational force is described by Einstein’s general theory of relativity. Bends and curves are caused in the fabric of space which exerts a force on other objects. The force is increased when there is more mass, but decreases with distance. Gravity explains how the Earth is kept on its orbit around the Sun, and similarly the moon maintains its orbit around the earth. It is responsible for the structure of the universe, but is actually the weakest force. </p>
                            <p>Electromagnetic force is typically used in a quantum context. Electrons are in orbit around the nucleus of an atom due to electromagnetism. Similar to gravity, mass and distance affect the strength of the force. However, one main difference is that attraction is based on charged particles. Positive and negative attract, while two of the same charges repel. Electromagnetism is stronger than gravity, but often results in neutral forces due to the charged particles balancing out.</p>
                            <p>A strong nuclear force is used in even smaller spaces than electromagnetism. They are responsible for the attraction of protons and neutrons within the nucleus of the atom. Protons and neutrons are made up of smaller pieces known as quarks. Strong nuclear forces help attract the opposite charges of quarks, keeping the nucleus intact. This force is trillions of times stronger than gravity and about 100 times stronger than electromagnetism. However, this only holds true for small distances, such as atoms. </p>
                            <p>Weak nuclear forces are also used for subatomic particles. Quarks have two varieties: up or down. The weak nuclear force can switch the quark positions from up or down, and cause a neutron to change into a proton. This would change the element and give it a positive charge. Such reactions happen within the Sun that give it energy to shine. This force is much weaker than strong nuclear force, but stronger than gravity. </p>
                            <h2>What is String Theory?</h2>
                            <p>For decades, physicists have struggled to relate quantum theory to Einsteins’ theory of relativity. These two ideas have never functioned together properly because Einstein’s theory didn’t hold true for all the four fundamental forces. The theory of relativity described the nature of gravity, but because gravity is such a weak force, it could not be applied to a quantum level. </p>
                            <p>String theory gained traction in the 1960s and 70s and is often called the theory of everything. On a quantum level, string theory suggests that known subatomic particles in physics are replaced by one dimensional objects known as strings. Strings would represent everything in the world, including light particles and matter. This would also explain the mass of electrons, neutrons, and protons. According to the theory, these small strings vibrate, twist, and fold. This movement produces large scale forces such as gravity and also explains the quantum forces. It is believed to be the unifying factor between all the fundamental forces. However when mathematics was applied, scientists found that it supported more than just the four fundamental forces.</p>
                            <p>Strings vibrate billions of times per second and can exist in up to ten dimensions. Another theory suggests up to twenty-six dimensions. Of course, these are invisible to humans, as we are only evolved to see three dimensions. However, this could offer a gateway into the concept of a multiverse. The first dimension would be a straight line with no direction. The second dimension would include height, and could be represented by a square. Third dimension is how humans view the world, and depth is added. This could be seen in a cube. The fourth dimension is usually known as time, which is relative to where you are in the universe. Beyond that delves into theoretical worlds that still remain a mystery to humankind.</p>
                            <p>Another theoretical concept that has emerged from string theory is a graviton — a point-like particle that is responsible for the force of gravity. Strings come in two types, open or closed. A graviton is believed to be a closed string that correlates gravity to quantum gravity. However, the force of gravity is one of the weakest and may not be possible to be found in the quantum world. A reason that graviton first became popular in theoretical physics is because of quarks. Quarks are bound together by gluons which resemble rubber bands. They cause tension and are similar to point-like particles. Physicists believed that these particles could aid in the discovery of gravitons, however all of this still remains very much theoretical. </p>
                            <p>String theory has led to many new doors opening in the world of theoretical science and continues to grow among physicists.</p>
                            <h2>String Theory’s Impact on Modern Physics</h2>
                            <p>String theory has remained unwavering in the field of mathematics. However, the only problem it has today is experimentation. Although numbers have all added up when it comes to strings, there is no way for scientists to actually conduct experiments about it. This has led to many disagreements in the existence of strings, as many claim science without predictions is only mathematics, and therefore can not be true. </p>
                            <p>Despite the fact that there may never be a way to prove string theory, it has had many successes in the world of astronomy and astrophysics. Although theoretical, it has helped in the study of black holes. Entropy is related to the thermodynamics in a black hole. In the 1970s, scientists Jacob Bekenstein and Stephen Hawking found that the entropy in black holes was very high. In 1996, scientists Andrew Strominger and Cumrun Vafa used mathematics from string theory to calculate the entropy of a black hole again. They found that it was the same result as Bekenstein and Hawking. This was the first time that modern physics could be calculated by using string theory. </p>
                            <p>Although this didn’t prove its existence, it has led to more mathematical correlations between theory and physics. It continues to grow and develop in the world of theoretical sciences. </p>
