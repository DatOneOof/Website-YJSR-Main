              Time travel is a notion which has been utilised in science fiction
              and movies for decades. An example of this is the movie
              Interstellar by Christopher Nolan which depicts the influence of
              an intense gravitational field on Matthew McConaughey’s crew,
              slowing time down for them. The discussions of time travel were
              initiated within physics following Einstein’s special theory of
              relativity.
            </p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">Einstein’s theories of relativity</h2>
            <p>
              Einstein developed two theories of relativity : General theory of
              relativity and Special theory of relativity.
            </p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">General relativity</h2>
            <p>
              Gravity may initially be seen as a force which acts by attracting
              objects according to their mass. The larger the mass, the more
              other objects will be pulled towards it. For example, planets
              orbiting the sun. However, certain examples show that gravity is
              not a force. As an example, rather than falling straight down
              towards the centre of the earth as we would expect, satellites’
              trajectories are curved, following the direction of rotation of
              the earth. If we were to continue with the theory that gravity is
              not a force, our current understanding of the universe would have
              to undergo a radical change. This formed the basis of general
              relativity.
            </p>
            <p>
              General relativity is based on the equivalence principle which
              states that at any point in space-time, gravitational and inertial
              effects cannot be distinguished. An example of this is freefall as
              freefall is not the acceleration of the object but rather the
              object’s natural movement. It is freefall which is our natural
              motion rather than rest. When we are standing on the Earth’s
              surface, we are resistant to freefall, exerting a constant upward
              acceleration. This explains why we feel our weight only when we
              touch the ground. [1] All objects which have a mass curve
              spacetime around them. If we were to send an object such as an
              apple into intergalactic emptiness, it would travel in a straight
              line at constant velocity. However, if we were to place Earth in
              this space and observe the motions of the apple now, it would
              present a curved trajectory towards Earth as due to Earth’s mass,
              it has distorted spacetime, leading the apple to arrive towards
              it.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Special relativity</h2>
            <p>
              This theory concerns the actions of objects as they approach the
              speed of light, delving into concepts such as time dilation and
              length contraction.
            </p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">Time dilation</h2>
            <p>
              The faster you move, the slower time ticks for you, relative to
              the observer. Not only does this occur for motion, but it occurs
              depending on the gravitational field strength you experience as
              well. The stronger the gravitational field, the slower time ticks
              for you. Focusing on the motion aspect, if one were to speed up,
              approaching the speed of light, time would tick slower and slower.
              This is called time dilation and it is not a merely hypothetical
              concept but rather one that has been tested and proved to be real
              by the 1971 Hafele-Keating experiments. In these experiments, two
              precisely measured atomic clocks were flown on planes travelling
              in opposite directions. The relative motion had a measurable
              impact, creating a time difference between the two clocks.[4]
            </p>

            />

            <p>
              The stationary time is the time measured in a stationary frame of
              reference As well as the experiments with atomic clocks on planes,
              this phenomenon has also been observed with particle decay. For
              example, a muon decays with a lifetime of 2.2*10-6 as measured in
              the lab. If a muon is moving at 99% of the speed of light, its
              lifetime, using the formula above would be 1.56*10-5. Furthermore,
              if a particle were to have a decay time of 9 minutes and it is
              greatly accelerated in a particle accelerator, its decay time
              would increase. It would decay after a certain amount of time
              which is the exact amount of time that was predicted by Einstein.
              [3] Rather than going at 99% of the speed of light, what if one
              were to travel at the speed of light? Photons already do this. As
              they already travel at this high speed, photons do not experience
              time. A photon being emitted from a star 30,000 years ago and then
              landing on a telescope will have happened in exactly the same
              instant relative to the photon.[3]
            </p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">Length contraction</h2>
            <p>
              At very high speeds, within 10% of the speed of light, the length
              of a moving object seen by a stationary observer shortens. The
              faster you travel, the smaller objects will seem to be as well as
              the distance you perceive yourself to be travelling. This would
              mean that it is possible to travel thousands of light years within
              just a few seconds. For example, we can imagine a rocket ship
              travelling from Earth to a distant celestial object. The two
              perspectives we can view are from an observer on Earth and from a
              person travelling in a rocket ship. When the Earth is the inertial
              reference frame, the ship is moving at constant velocity and time
              is moving at the familiar rate. The distance for the journey is
              able to be measured as the ‘proper length’. This is from an
              observer who is at rest with respect to the start and endpoints.
              [5] Using the ship as the inertial reference frame, the only thing
              that is the same is the relative velocity of the ship to the Earth
              and to the celestial object. The observer in the ship is in motion
              with respect to the start and endpoints. Because of time dilation,
              the time interval would be different and using the equation below,
              we can attain the contracted length. Therefore, this would mean
              that the ship is longer whereas the journey is shorter. For the
              observer on the earth, the ship is shorter but the journey is
              longer. The relationship between the contracted length and the
              proper length is shown by this equation
            </p>

            />
            <p class="img-cap">
              l’ = contracted length <br />
              l = proper length <br />
              [6]
            </p>
            <p>
              A practical example of Einstein’s special relativity would be GPS
              satellites. These satellites orbit far away enough from Earth to
              have a measurable difference in their spacetime conditions. The
              Earth’s gravitational field is weaker for these satellites than
              for us on Earth, meaning that time ticks more slowly for them.
              They gain around 38 microseconds per day due to time dilation.
              Despite this, we’re still able to receive accurate measurements
              from them because the time differences are corrected to adjust to
              our spacetime continuum.
            </p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">Is time travel possible?</h2>
            <p>
              The effects of time dilation could potentially allow us to see
              into the future. We observe the stars from Earth as they were
              billions of years ago, meaning that we essentially look into the
              past when looking at the sky. However, for us to utilise this, we
              would have to take advantage of the strong gravitational field of
              black holes or send a traveller in a rocket ship at close to the
              speed of light. Our current technology has not permitted us to do
              this as of yet but in the future with more advanced technology,
              this could be possible. [2]
