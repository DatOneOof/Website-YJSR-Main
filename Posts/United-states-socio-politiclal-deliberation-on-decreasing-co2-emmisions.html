                        <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>In the past 2 years, the United States energy production sector has reported releasing approximately 10.2 billion metric tons of CO<sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere (EIA: Energy Information Administration 8). In the long run, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions pose a threat to the climate and environment. Nearly 46% of the emitted CO<sub>2</sub> is derived from burning petroleum and the other 54% is from burning coal and natural gases (EIA). In 2020, the USA’s per capita emissions were almost double that of Japan or Germany or even China (Zulinski). Due to the high amounts of CO<sub>2</sub> production in America, the US is one of the main contributors to climate change. In the past 10 years, the high fluctuation of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere has caused the average surface temperature of the earth to increase by 1.0o F and a detrimental process called ocean acidification- the pH of the ocean’s surface decreases (Lindsey). A decrease of pH may sound trifle, but it causes a 30% increase in acidity levels, which can interfere with marine life development (Lindsey). Subsequently, to prevent climate change and environmental degradation, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions must be addressed at a global level in order to bring change.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Cap-and-Trade Policy</h2>
                        <p>Among the many bills that have been passed by Congress, the Cap-and-trade legislation has been deemed a great success in America to reduce emissions. The Cap-and-trade system enforces limitations on greenhouse gases across industries (cap) and allows companies to create a supply and demand market that lets them emit a certain amount and sell their allowances (trade) (McClain and Meier 8).  According to the United States Environmental protection agency, the Cap-and-trade system provides “flexibility (flexible) banking” and “a greater level of environmental certainty”, in comparison to alternative options ( United States Environmental Protection Agency 1,4).  In general, the benefits of this policy include an increase in government revenue, inexpensive disbursements and proper regulation of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Despite the favorable outcomes, this program poses a threat to the poor and the minority communities.The Food and Water organization issued brief reports that in 2018, most facilities of the cap-and-trade program in California were primarily located in “vulnerable” communities, thus causing the locals to be exposed to toxic pollutants, including mercury, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides (3).  Furthermore, the report claims that The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative’s approach to the cap-and-trade program “has not proven to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and has likely encouraged the shift to natural gas-fired power plants” (The Food and Water Organization 4). The threat that this policy imposes on the impoverished community causes friction between both politics and ethics.  Even though carbon pricing can lead to faster cuts in climate change and cause an increase in government revenue, the system could be considered a disadvantage to people in poverty.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Carbon Taxing</h2>
                        <p>Much like the cap-and-trade policy, the federal carbon tax is a fee for each metric ton of carbon dioxide that is emitted into the atmosphere, thus decreasing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. However, unlike Cap-and-trade, carbon taxing is more of a clear-cut system and lessens the implications of the government (C2ES).  The pricing of the carbon tax may fluctuate depending on political factors, like economic energy prices or the emission rates of that year. In fact, the World Bank states that carbon pricing has been raised to $40-80 in the US to reach the target given by The Paris Agreement: an international treaty in 2015 to raise awareness of climate change. The nations who adopted the treaty agreed to cut down their “climate-altering pollution” (World Bank Group 34). The cost of carbon has almost doubled within the last decade, thus increasing net revenue and energy prices (United States Environmental Protection Agency 4). Due to the escalating prices of carbon tax, governments believe that energy providers will decarbonize their process and become more environmentally safe. In spite of these positive results, for the vast majority of consumers that have to deal with high priced "electricity, gasoline, home-heating fuels, and other fossil fuel–based energy sources”, carbon taxing is seen as a burden (Marron and Morris 1).  As stated by Chad Stone, the chief economist at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, “A carbon tax should not make poor families poorer or push more people into poverty” (32). He further states that to relieve financial stress put on these low-income families, carbon tax legislation should use the revenues earned from high-income families to cushion the impact on poorer families (Stone 33). This tax, in general, is jeopardizing the financial stability of an average American, thus limiting the support received from the public. It remains that overall, carbon taxing is arguably one of the most effective policies to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. It sets a price for carbon, which can be an advantage for the government to obtain revenue, thus increasing infrastructure and efficient energy production in society.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Renewable energy Policies</h2>
                        <p>In addition to the carbon taxing and the cap-and-trade act, the US government is attempting to reinforce policies that include renewable energy as a source to build clean energy. <i>The American renewable energy and efficiency act</i>, a legislation put forth by Senator Markey is an effort to establish and promote clean energy with a net CO<sub>2</sub> emission of zero (Markey, 2). Furthermore, the act amends the national target of energy that comes from a renewable source to 25%, thus creating less CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and creating job opportunities in the US (United States). Despite political background, a vast number of Americans strongly support the idea of renewable energy. According to a study done by the Yale program on climate change communications, “People want their energy sources to be clean and cheap” (Gustafson et al.). Perhaps this is the overarching reasoning behind the support for renewable energy, but as stated in the report, “The main takeaway is that Democrats, more than Republicans, support renewable energy out of the desire to reduce global warming...In contrast, Republicans, more so than Democrats, support renewable energy for economic reasons like cost-saving and economic growth” (Gustafson et al.). Looking past the political divisions, renewable energy is beneficial to the American people due to increasing job opportunities in the transportation, energy, and technology sector. In fact, the International Renewable Energy Agency’s annual review states that approximately 855,000 people were employed by renewable energy corporations in the US in 2018, about 11 million jobs globally (Renner et al. 24). Despite all these positive outcomes, switching to renewable sources can cause conflicts over land use and local disputes. As stated by Samantha Gross, the director of the Energy Security and Climate initiative, most of these energy projects are built near homes, which can indirectly be a disadvantage and cause a visually unappealing view for the local residents (Gross 14). Renewable energy in general carries the benefits of increasing employment rates and producing 100% clean energy, even though it can be a nuisance and a distraction to the community.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Recommendation</h2>
                        <p>Regardless of the encouraging results of carbon taxes, cap and trade, and renewable energy, it is important that the US government pushes forward with the necessary allocations. In order to decrease the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted in the US, it is recommended that the United States Department of Energy use the proceeds earned from carbon taxing to fund renewable energy projects. Even though it requires massive amounts of land, industrial resources like steel and concrete, and increased tariffs (AEI), both the government and the American people are in favor of these policies; therefore, increasing the likelihood of cleaner energy. In order to address this system properly, the government, major energy sectors, as well as the American community must have a strong enforcement and involvement in these projects to ensure promising results and environmentally favorable outcomes in the future.</p>
