                        <h2 class="section-heading">What even is Scoliosis?</h2>
                        <p>Scoliosis can simply be defined as an abnormal curvature in the spine. “Abnormal” is important to note because all spines have somewhat of a curve. A curve of over 10 degrees, shown on an X-ray, is what confirms a case of scoliosis. While most scoliosis cases are mild, extreme ones can be disabling and cause many inconveniences. The condition typically affects adolescent children ranging from ages 10 to 15.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Diagnosis</h2>
                        <p>Symptoms and signs of scoliosis include differences in the shoulder, shoulder blade, leg, and/or hip height, as well as a visibly abnormal curved spine. The most commonly performed way to diagnose a case of scoliosis is an X-ray. Examples of other imaging tests used include MRIs and CT scans. All of these tests will provide a detailed image of the spine so that a physician can properly identify the measure of the curve.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Rare cases and causes</h2>
                        <p>These cases, as the title implies, are extremely rare and do not represent the majority of scoliosis diagnoses.</p>
                        <p>
                            Although the causes for 80% of scoliosis diagnoses are unknown, the few 20% can be linked to conditions such as:
                            <ul class="cont-list">
                                <li>Neuromuscular conditions, such as cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, and <a href="Spina-bifida.html">spina bifida</a> (due to weak and fragile muscles)</li>
                                <li>Infections and/or injuries to the spine</li>
                                <li>Misshapen vertebrae</li>
                                <li>Degenerative disc disease</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">So let’s talk about treatment</h2>
                        <p>
                            Although there are various treatments for scoliosis, it’s not always necessary, especially in cases with very mild spine curvature. Options for treatment include:
                            <ul class="cont-list">
                                <li>Back bracing, especially in cases of mild curvature (20 to 40 degrees). These braces are to be worn for a prescribed amount of hours given to a patient by their doctor, which is usually between 8 to 23 hours, depending on the severity of the curve.</li>
                                <li>Surgery, in extreme cases (50 or more degrees)</li>
                                <li>Physical therapy, typically used in degenerative cases</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Scoliosis Myths</h2>
                        <p>
                            Examples of common myths surrounding scoliosis include:
                            <ol class="cont-list">
                                <li>Scoliosis makes you fragile, or in other words, a person would not be able to do certain activities, such as sports, due to the condition</li>
                                <li>Carrying some sort of heavy luggage will worsen one’s curvature</li>
                                <li>Surgery is the only effective treatment for scoliosis</li>
                                <li>Having certain back issues, such as intense back pain, can be an indication or effect of scoliosis.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Let’s Debunk</h2>
                        <p>
                            Although many of these beliefs about scoliosis may seem surprising, it is shocking how common some of these myths are, precisely in spaces with people with scoliosis. Now, let’s debunk all of these myths.
                            <ol class="cont-list">
                                <li>Only in very rare and extreme cases would one’s curvature affect their daily activities, such as walking, and even their ability to participate in sports. A mild or slightly above mild degree curve certainly does not affect your abilities.</li>
                                <li>This is simply not true. Many people carry heavy backpacks, and although this is not a healthy practice in regards to posture and back/shoulder pain, it has no correlation to one’s spine curvature.</li>
                                <li>Well, this myth has already been debunked in this article! In most cases, surgery is only a viable option when the curve is 50 degrees or higher. A great and very effective option, if done correctly, is also back bracing.</li>
                                <li>Typically scoliosis, disregarding very extreme cases, can go unnoticed in adolescents, making it very hard for one to just know if they have scoliosis. In fact, many patients find out about their abnormal curvature as a surprise- perhaps at an annual physical check-up. The causes of scoliosis are mainly unknown, and overall the condition is known to be idiopathic- not having a cause. However, doctors have concluded that a few cases can be linked to hereditary factors. All in all, back issues, such as back pains, have never been an immediate symptom of early onset scoliosis.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">To sum it all up</h2>
                        <p>Overall, scoliosis is a common, non-life-threatening condition that can be treated with the right medical care/attention. If you or someone you know suspects that they may have scoliosis, it’s best to seek guidance from a physician.</p>
