              “What is the largest natural number possible?” At first glance,
              this question appears straightforward, but it leads to a journey
              into the enigmatic and endless regions of mathematics. Imagine
              counting numbers, starting from 1 and going on forever. Regardless
              of how far you count, there's always room to add one more. In this
              world of natural numbers, there is no endpoint, no ‘largest’
              number to reach. This is the doorway to “infinity”.
            </p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">The Infinity Symbol ∞</h2>
            <p>
              The infinity symbol (∞) is a mathematical symbol that represents
              the concept of infinity. Also known as a “lemniscate” or a “lazy
              eight”, this symbol has a rich history and is widely recognized
              across various fields. It was first introduced mathematically by
              John Wallis, an English mathematician, in the 17th century.
              However, its origins trace back even further. The lemniscate, a
              similar shape to the infinity symbol, has been a common decorative
              motif since ancient times, appearing on Viking Age combs and other
              artifacts. You can see an example above.
            </p>

            <p class="img-cap">Figure 1: A comb with lemniscate decoration</p>
            <p>
              The exact reason behind Wallis' choice of the infinity symbol
              remains unclear. Some theories suggest that it may have been based
              on a variant form of a Roman numeral or the lower-case form of
              omega, the last letter in the Greek alphabet. Regardless of its
              origin, the symbol quickly gained popularity and found its way
              into various fields beyond mathematics, such as bookbinding.
            </p>

            <p class="img-cap">

              in 1655
            </p>
            <p>
              In mathematics, the symbol is commonly used to represent potential
              infinity rather than an actual infinite quantity. It often appears
              in expressions involving summations and limits, indicating that a
              variable grows arbitrarily large towards infinity. For example,
              the equation above represents the sum of a geometric series that
              converges to the value of 2. In bookbinding, it is used to
              indicate that a book is printed on acid-free paper, ensuring its
              longevity. On cameras and lenses, the infinity symbol signifies
              that the lens is set to focus at an infinite distance, one of the
              oldest symbols used in photography.

            <p>
              In modern mysticism and literature, the infinity symbol has a deep
              metaphorical value. It is sometimes associated with the ouroboros,
              an ancient symbol of a snake eating its own tail that symbolizes
              the endless cycle of life and death. In works by authors like
              Vladimir Nabokov and James Joyce, the figure-eight shape of the
              infinity symbol is used to symbolize the infinite and the
              interconnectedness of different elements.

            <h2 class="section-heading">Zeno's Dichotomy Paradox</h2>
            <p>
              Now that we know more about the infinity symbol, let's shift our
              focus to the infinity paradoxes. The first paradox is Zeno’s
              Dichotomy Paradox. To illustrate this paradox, let's consider
              Zeno's journey from his house to the park. After a long day of
              contemplation, he decides to take a leisurely stroll. In the first
              leg of his journey, Zeno must reach the halfway point to the park,
              a task that consumes some finite amount of time. Once he arrives
              at this midway juncture, he faces another finite duration to
              traverse the remaining half of the distance. However, before he
              can complete that, Zeno encounters yet another division—this time,
              he must cross half of the remaining half. The cycle continues
              endlessly, with Zeno constantly dividing the distance into smaller
              and smaller segments, each demanding a finite amount of time. This
              repetitious process raises a perplexing question: How long will it
              take for Zeno to reach the park?
            </p>
            <p>
              As simple as it may appear, the answer to the preceding question
              is that you will never reach the park. To top it all off, even if
              he tried an infinite number of times (infinity isn't a number, but
              for the purpose of argument, let's pretend it is), he'd still be
              unable to open the door. The simple answer is that each action
              brings him closer to the park, but the next one only covers half
              the distance covered by the previous steps. The steps he takes
              consequently never really close the gap. There’s also another neat
              piece of parlor logic that can be applied here, apart from the
              step method. In terms of time, an infinite number of things cannot
              be accomplished in a finite period of time; hence, Zeno cannot
              reach the park.
            </p>

            <img src="../assets/others/para-6.png" alt="" class="illus-img" />
            <p>
              Let's look at the mathematical description of Zeno's stroll to
              help us solve the paradox. Assume Zeno's house is one mile away
              from the park and he walks at a constant speed of one mile per
              hour. Common sense dictates that the trip should take one hour.
              However, let us examine it from Zeno's point of view, breaking
              down the voyage into smaller chunks. We can see that the first
              half of the trip takes half an hour, the second half takes a
              quarter of an hour, the third part takes an eighth of an hour, and
              so on. These time intervals create an infinite series, with each
              term representing the time required to cross each distance
              segment. Zeno might argue that the total should be infinite
              because there are infinitely many terms on the right side of the
              equation and each term is finite.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, here is where mathematics comes in handy. Mathematicians
              realized that it is feasible to add an unlimited number of
              finite-sized terms and still have a finite result. Consider a
              square with a one-unit area to demonstrate this. We divide the
              square into smaller sections repeatedly, like we did with Zeno's
              trip. Each division produces more parts, and as the process
              continues, the total area covered by these pieces approaches the
              complete area of the square. In mathematical words, when the
              number of divisions approaches infinity, the entire square becomes
              totally covered. Nonetheless, the square's area remains the same
              at one unit.
            </p>
            <img src="../assets/others/para-7.png" alt="" class="illus-img" />
            <p>
              This method is similar to the infinite series that symbolizes
              Zeno's journey's time intervals. And, like with the size of a
              square, the infinite sum of these finite time intervals yields a
              finite value. It equals one hour in this situation. And the
              paradox is resolved by acknowledging the convergence of infinite
              terms to a finite value, aligning with our intuitive understanding
              of motion and time.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">The Infinite Hotel Paradox</h2>
            <p>
              The brilliant German mathematician David Hilbert offered a
              compelling thought experiment—a paradox. If you will—to challenge
              our concept of infinity in the booming 1920s, enter the
              fascinating "Infinite Hotel," where numbers no longer behave as we
              expect them to. Imagine a hotel with an infinite number of rooms,
              each uniquely occupied by a guest. A seemingly insurmountable
              challenge awaits the night manager when an additional guest
              arrives, seeking lodging. Rather than turning the traveler away,
              this enterprising manager devises a plan to accommodate the
              newcomer. The manager's ingenious solution defies common sense yet
              is mathematically sound. He asks the guest in room number 1 to
              move to room 2, the occupant of room 2 to room 3, and so forth.
              Every guest relocates to the next room, effectively creating an
              opening in room number 1 for the new arrival. This process can be
              repeated for any finite number of newcomers, smoothly shuffling
              guests and ensuring each arrival finds a room.
            </p>
            <p>
              But here's where things take a mesmerizing twist. Imagine an
              infinitely large bus, carrying an infinite number of passengers.
              The night manager faces an unparalleled challenge but remains
              undaunted. Through a brilliantly crafted strategy rooted in prime
              numbers, he assigns every existing guest a new room number based
              on powers of two, and each passenger on the bus a room number
              based on powers of subsequent prime numbers. Astonishingly, this
              meticulously designed plan opens up rooms for all passengers,
              leaving the hotel as bustling as ever. As word spreads of this
              extraordinary hotel, travelers from far and wide flock to the
              Infinite Hotel. Nights pass without incident until an unimaginable
              scenario unfolds—a procession of infinitely large buses, each
              carrying an infinite number of passengers, stretches into the
              horizon. What can the night manager do to prevent an infinite loss
              of revenue and secure his job? Remarkably, he invokes the timeless
              knowledge of Euclid, who, around 300 B.C.E., demonstrated the
              existence of an infinite quantity of prime numbers. Armed with
              this insight, the night manager assigns every current guest to the
              first prime number, 2, raised to the power of their current room
              number. So, the current occupant of room number 7 goes to room
              number , which is room 128. The night manager then takes the
              people on the first of the infinite buses and assigns them to the
              room number of the next prime, 3, raised to the power of their
              seat number on the bus. So, the person in seat number 7 on the
              first bus goes to room number or room number 2,187. While some
              rooms may remain unfilled due to their incompatibility with prime
              factors, the night manager's strategies prove successful. His job
              remains secure, thanks to a fundamental principle.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, we must acknowledge that these structured strategies
              would falter when confronted with higher orders of infinity, such
              as that of real numbers.

              />The "Real Number Infinite Hotel" would present an entirely
              different set of challenges, featuring negative number rooms in
              the basement, fractional accommodations, and even rooms named
              after famous mathematical constants like π(pi).
