                        <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>Sorting algorithms are a fundamental tool in computer science, with applications ranging from data analysis to machine learning.  Sorting algorithms allow us to rearrange datasets into a desired order to make the dataset easier to search, analyze, and visualize.  While sorting algorithms are generally applied to two-dimensional spaces, they can also be applied to the nth dimension, where <i>n</i> is a positive integer. This paper will explore the difficulties and strategies to sorting n-dimensional datasets with the focus on performance and efficiency.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Related Work</h2>
                        <p>Sorting algorithms have been a topic in computer science for some time now, with a wide range of applications from data management to machine learning. While previous research for sorting algorithms focused on the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> dimension, there has been little focus on n-dimensional datasets. There is a growing need for more efficient sorting in n-dimensions to improve the efficiency of machine learning and other fields as a whole.</p>
                        <p>A variety of algorithms have been proposed for n-dimensional sorting, such as space-filling curve methods and parallelization techniques, but there are still many difficulties within the field and it is not yet incredibly optimized. Memory usage and time complexity is a common trade off, and future technologies hope to stop this issue.</p>
                        <p>This research fills a gap in computer science by exploring the challenges for sorting in n-dimensions and highlights different algorithms uses and time complexities</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Body</h2>
                        <p>There are two types of sorting algorithms: comparison-based and non-comparison-based.  According to NIST, a comparison-based sorting algorithm is defined as “any sort algorithm using comparisons between keys, and nothing else about the keys, to arrange items in a predetermined order.” [1]  On the other hand, non-comparison sorting algorithms are simply algorithms that do not compare elements while sorting.  There are various types of sorting algorithms, each with its own set of strengths and weaknesses.  Some common types of sorting algorithms include bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, and quick sort.</p>
                        <p>Bubble sort is an algorithm that loops through datasets and swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.  It has a time complexity of O(n<sup>2</sup>) in a worst case scenario, which proves to be inefficient with large datasets.  Imagine a scenario where 100 elements need to be sorted, the scenario would call for 10,000 comparisons (100<sup>2</sup>). For 1,000 elements, there would need to be 1,000,000 comparisons (1000<sup>2</sup>). In conclusion, algorithms with an O(n<sup>2</sup>) time complexity are generally not a plausible option for large datasets, and are often replaced by <i>O(n·log(n))</i> sorting algorithms, such as merge or quick sort.</p>

                        <p class="img-cap">Figure 1</p>
                        <p>While inefficient for large datasets, O(n<sup>2</sup>) algorithms are still commonly used for smaller datasets.  For example, take insertion sort, another sorting algorithm with a time complexity of O(n<sup>2</sup>).  Insertion sort loops through a dataset and inserts each element in its correct position relative to the elements that come before it.  While insertion sort and bubble sort both have a time complexity of O(n<sup>2</sup>), insertion sort is generally considered quicker due to its smaller comparison and swap count. Another commonly used O(n<sup>2</sup>) algorithm is selection sort, a sorting algorithm that repeatedly finds the smallest element within the dataset and sets it to the beginning of the dataset.</p>

                        <p class="img-cap">Figure 3</p>
                        <p>For larger datasets, algorithms with a time complexity of <i>O(n·log(n))</i> are more desirable. Merge sort and quick sort are two sorting algorithms with a time complexity of <i>O(n·log(n))</i>, which is quicker than all the algorithms mentioned thus far. Merge sort divides a dataset into smaller datasets, sorting each one, and then merging the sorted datasets back together. On the other hand, quick sort selects a pivot element and partitions the dataset around it, such that all elements smaller than the pivot are placed to the left of it and all elements larger than the pivot are placed to the right. Afterwards, it recursively sorts the left and right partitions.</p>

                        <p>There are a variety of applications for 2D dataset sorting.  For example, you can sort a list of points in a coordinate system, a matrix, 2D shapes (based on area, perimeter, etc), 2D images (size, resolution), and other applications. To compare the performance of the different sorting algorithms in this context, you could compare the number of comparisons and swaps performed by each algorithm to determine which algorithm is most efficient for the task.  You could also simply measure the time that it takes for the algorithm to complete by taking advantage of the time module in Python or through using other comparable methods.</p>
                        <p>While sorting algorithms are often designed to work with one or two dimensional data, they can also be applied to n-dimensional space, where <i>n</i> is a positive integer.  However, sorting n-dimensional data comes with challenges. There are two major challenges when it comes to sorting in the nth dimension: the increased complexity of the data, and the increased space complexity which causes the algorithm to need to store more information in memory to sort the datasets.  To overcome these challenges, researchers have developed sorting algorithms with the sole purpose for working with n-dimensional datasets.</p>
                        <p>For example, the bucket sort algorithm is a sorting algorithm that divides a dataset into a number of buckets based on the values of the different dimensions.  Afterwards, the data is sorted within each bucket and the sorted buckets are merged to form the final sorted data.  Another example is the radix sort, a sorting algorithm which sorts a dataset by the digits of the different dimensions.  It is most efficient and often used for sorting large datasets with a small dimension count.</p>
                        <p>Sorting in the <i>nth</i> dimension has applications within a variety of fields.  For example, sorting algorithms can identify patterns and trends in n-dimensional space, such as recognizing clusters of points or correlations between dimensions. They can also be used to improve the rendering performance of 3D graphics by sorting the objects in the scene based on their distance from the viewer.  On top of that, sorting in the nth dimension is extensively used in machine learning, such as being used to pre-process data before training a model.</p>
                        <p>For example, imagine you had a dataset of 10,000 points in 3-dimensional space, representing the features of different people.  The dataset included three features: height, weight, and age.  Your goal is to use machine learning to predict the athletic performance of each person based on these features.  You could use a decision tree algorithm, which is an algorithm that recursively splits the data based on the feature that provides the most information gain.  You can sort the data by the target variable prior to the model’s training with the goal of improving performance of the decision tree in mind.  This will guarantee that similar points are grouped together, therefore improving the accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm.</p>
                        <p>To sort the data, using a sorting algorithm designed to be used in n-dimensions, such as bucket sort would be optimal.  You could pass the sorted dataset to the decision tree algorithm and train the model using the sorted data.  The model would predict the popularity of the products based on their features because of this process.</p>
                        <p>While there are plenty of applications of n-dimensional sorting algorithms, some became displeased with the optimization of the systems.  Because of this, researchers have developed countless techniques for optimizing sorting algorithms designed to work in the nth dimension.  One discovery is the use of space-filling curves, which are continuous functions that map n-dimensional space onto a one-dimensional space.  According to Marsha Berger, “Space-filling curves provide an inexpensive way to map an interval to a three-dimensional domain.” [2]  In other words, using a space-filling curve allows you to reorder the data in a way that reduces the comparisons and swap count needed to sort the data.  Another approach is parallelization, which divides the data into smaller pieces and sorts them in parallel using multiple processors which can improve the performance of the algorithm due to the reduced amount of time needed to sort the data.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>In conclusion, sorting algorithms play a crucial role in a variety of fields, from simple data management to machine learning.  While sorting algorithms are especially important in n-dimensional data, working in n-dimensional space can be daunting.  This paper explored the applications of sorting algorithms in two dimensions to n dimensions, and it compared the performance of different algorithms in these contexts.  We also discussed optimization techniques, such as space-filling curves or parallelization, and presented examples of improved sorting algorithms designed for working in n-dimensional space.  Overall, the research shows the importance and applications of sorting algorithms in n-dimensional space, and that there is still much to learn about how to optimize and improve algorithms to meet computer scientist's needs.</p>
