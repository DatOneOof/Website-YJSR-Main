                        <p>The methodology we deploy to analyse performance in sports today has recently seen a drastic transformation. With the incorporation of advanced statistical modelling, what used to be a result of watching a player or team for hours on end has now been reduced to a series of spreadsheets full of formulae. This method - derided in sports like basketball (APBRmetrics), and often used in others like baseball (SABRmetrics) – has become a subject of endless debate. </p>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Game on!</h2>
                        <p>First developed in 1964 by a group of “baseball nerds”, most notably Earnshaw Cook and Bill James (the inventor of the term SABRmetrics), advanced statistics compare and evaluate the overall athleticism of an athlete. Making note of their current athletic readiness and predicting their future athletic success, they are thus considered crucial to the athletic development of a sportsman/team. So, it’s barely any surprise that, with its introduction in sports, the game plans have changed, giving sports a much richer output and analysts the ability to produce better quality sportsmen. The field has now come to a form whereby, with the help of wearable tech, a real-time analysis of a player is possible, too, allowing coaches to alter gameplay strategy on the fly. For, using multiple comprehensive analysis software, analysts can now obtain neuromuscular data that can help them predict and prevent sports injuries if need be. The Sports Data Analytics market, as a result, is expected to reach upwards of 4.5 billion USD by 2025 [1]</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Game off?</h2>
                        <p>Howbeit, casual sports fans, conversely, have been equally vocal about their contempt for analytics. As per them, the analytics movement is about stat geeks who have never played the game and believe that math trumps everything. “Is that true?” You ask. Sometimes, yes, but mostly, a big no. For forward-thinking coaches have always explored new ways to analyse and attack the game, to test their hypotheses against any available data. One example of this is that of the professional basketball team Dallas Mavericks which used advanced stats to make a key lineup change in the 2011 NBA Finals and by virtue of that, won the game [2] Howbeit, one can also not deny the fact that the analysis of a game or player can sometimes hinge on the tactics employed by the opposing team and thus, can backfire. There is also the question about the safety of sportsmen’s personal data analytics can be leveraged to compromise their security. For experienced bettors use data analysis to track public money, betting trends, projected win probabilities, and more. Technology is becoming more and more pervasive regardless, and the industry is only expected to grow as more accurate analytical tools become available. What greater impact will it have on the future of sports, only time will tell.</p>
