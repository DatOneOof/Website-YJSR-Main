                        <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>Love. It is a grandiose word; it is a grandiose emotion; it has a grandiose reputation. For many, it seems to be some sort of outwardly sensation, associated with indescribable joy and happiness. The symbol of love? The heart. The heart that pounds when we approach someone that we are attracted to; the heart that bursts with happiness when we are in a relationship; the heart that shatters when a relationship ends.  This is the cultural description of love. However, what is the science of love? Is there any?</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Biological Perspective of Love</h2>
                        <p>Well, for biologists, there appears to be a formula to define love and its process. According to Dr. Helen Fisher at Rutgeers, love fits into three categories: lust, attraction, and attachment. Each category involves the release of specific hormones and neurotransmitters in the nervous system.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Lust</h2>
                        <p>Lust, commonly known as sexual desires or a need to reproduce. This trait evolved in humans since reproduction is essential for our race to survive and expand.  Lust involves testogen and estrogen, the male and female sexual hormones respectively.</p>
                        <p>The process of lust occurs when within the brain, the hypothalamus, the main regulator of hormones, stimulates the production of sex hormones: testosterone and estrogen. This creates a pressing sexual desire or motivation that needs to be satisfied. It is known as sexual drive and is often so primal that it depletes the person’s ability to think rationally. This is why in the process of love, people think not with their heads, but with their hearts or sexual desires. This process can occur automatically, when there is an instinctual need for sexual gratification or reproduction to ensure that you contribute to the future and pass on your genes. On the other hand, it could be sensory as well, when the thalamus receives stimulating sensory information, contributing to the release of sexual hormones.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Attraction</h2>
                        <p>The second part of love is “attraction”. While attraction seems similar to lust, there are major differences. Namely, the sense of reward/punishment behaviour, attributed to S.K Skinner’s psychological theory of Behaviorism. When you first enter a relationship with someone you are attracted to, the first few months appear magical. This phenomena can be explained with science as well. The hypothalamus releases dopamine, the “feel-good hormone” or “happy”. This can occur when you spend time with a loved one or a partner. Moreover, the hormone norepinephrine is released during attraction. These two chemicals increase feelings of euphoria, energy, and happiness. In fact, brain scans of people in love showed high levels of activity in the “reward” section of the brain, such as the ventral tegmental area. This process of reward further reinforces the behaviour of attachment, as it releases chemicals that cause pleasure. Also, attraction appears to reduce serotonin, a hormone associated with mood and appetite. Interestingly, People suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder( OCD) also have low levels of serotonin, perhaps the reason behind the infatuation during the beginning stages of the relationship.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Attachment</h2>
                        <p>Finally, attachment, the necessary factor for long-term relationships. Of course, attachment involves not just romantic relationships; it includes friendships, familial bonds, or social friendliness. The two primary hormones related to attachment are oxytocin.</p>
                        <p>Oxytocin, commonly known as the “cuddle hormone” or the “love hormone”, creates feelings of “us against them”. It bonds the person with another, creating a sense of connection. The strength of this connection varies depending on whether it is a distant family, friend, or lover. Oxytocin also manifests feelings of physical and emotional protectiveness. It encourages behaviour to protect one’s partner during times of turmoil. It is released in the largest quantities during sex, childbirth, and breastfeeding. While these events seem drastically different, they all are a significant aspect of bonding.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Why does Love Hurt?</h2>
                        <p>While these hormones explain the beautiful side of love, there are moments of rejection or ending a relationship. The feelings of despair, hurt, and pain. How are these emotions explained in the biological sense? Well, the hormone dopamine plays a significant part. Essentially, the feelings of happiness or “reward” can be also found in addictions. There is a connection between love and addictions due to the psychological term tolerance. As one spends more time with their partners, their bodies get used to the amount of dopamine released, and for continuation of the feelings of happiness, there arises a need for more intimate actions or behaviours. In short, as relationships progress, people become more emotionally dependent on their partners for happiness.  Thus, when breakups occur, people enter “love withdrawal”, and this involves similar feelings of pain.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">The “Magical” Formula for Love</h2>
                        <p>So this is the “magical” formula for love: lust, attraction, and attachment. Lust with the release of testosterone and estrogen. Attraction with the release of dopamine and norepinephrine. Attachment with the release of oxytocin.  However, defining love into these three terms is at best simplistic. Love is complex, nuanced, and indescribable with words. The process of attraction: finding someone you are attracted to, finding someone that you want to spend the rest of your days with, finding someone that you just have a connection with, finding someone that you can let your guard down with, or finding someone who you accept for all their flaws. Science cannot explain this process, regardless of the amount of variables. And yes, hormones do explain connections, but the strength of the connection in love is incomprehensible.  If I tried to define love, this article could be 20 pages long and still not be enough. Yes, there is science behind love. But I believe love transcends science.</p>
