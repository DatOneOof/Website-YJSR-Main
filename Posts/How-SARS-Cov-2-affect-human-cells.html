                        <p>SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) has claimed the lives of millions of people worldwide since it was first identified in the city of Wuhan in China.</p>
                        <p>This virus is mainly transmitted via respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes within a range of about 1.8 metres. Indirect contact via contaminated surfaces is another cause of infection. Symptoms of SARS usually include fever, chills, and body pain, and infection can develop into pneumonia. Studies have also identified a range of animals—such as cats, ferrets, hamsters, apes, fruit bats, and rabbits—that are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>
                        <p>SARS-CoV-2 is a very fast virus with the unique ability to prevent our immune system from recognizing and combating infection in the early stages. By the time the immune system does realize there is a virus, there is so much of it that immune-response proteins sometimes flood the bloodstream at a faster rate than normal — which can cause damage. This was observed early in the pandemic in some people with COVID-19 who were harmed by an overactive immune response.</p>
                        <p>SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus consisting of a single-stranded RNA genome and the structural proteins needed to invade host cells. Once inside the cell, the RNA is used to encode structural proteins, non-structural proteins and accessory proteins.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">The Dramatic Entry</h2>
                        <p>Each SARS-CoV-2 virion has 24–40 haphazardly arranged spike proteins on its outer surface that are key to its fusing with human cells. These spikes are attached to the virus body at one end and are free to move around and rotate at the other (fig. 1). Presumably, this makes it easier for the proteins to scan the cell surface and for multiple spikes to bind to a human cell.</p>
                        <img class="illus-img" src="../assets/others/how_sars_cov_2_affects_human_cells_soham (1).png" style="width: 45%;">
                        <p class="img-cap">Figure 1: Structure of SARS-CoV-2</p>
                        <p>The Receptor Binding Domains (RBD’s) of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins attach to proteins on the outside of the human throat and lung cells, called ACE2 receptors. Once the viral spikes bind to ACE2, other proteins like the TMPRSS2 enzyme on the host cell’s surface initiate a process that leads to the merging of the viral and cell membranes. The virus then ejects its genome directly into the cell.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">The Great Nefarious Takeover</h2>
                        <p>The virus does not have its own proteins to enable its mRNA translation. So, it uses the already existing translation machinery of the host cell: the ribosomes.</p>
                        <p>Ribosomes are responsible for synthesizing proteins by translating the information on the host’s mRNA into a string of amino acids, and are an important part of the human cell.</p>
                        <p>After the viral RNA enters the cell, ribosomes in the cytoplasm translate two sections of viral RNA into long strings of amino acids, which are then snipped into proteins, including many involved in RNA synthesis. These first translated proteins enable further replication of viral mRNA and enable production of viral proteins.</p>
                        <p>They also recruit host proteins to systematically cleave cellular mRNA’s that don’t have a viral tag, and suppress the infected cell’s own protein production by 70%.</p>
                        <p>Besides the negative effects on normal cell functions, viral proteins block exit channels in the nucleus, preventing cellular mRNA from getting out. The mRNA includes instructions for interferons (proteins meant to alert the immune system about infection). By doing so, leader protein inhibits production of interferons anti-viral factors, leading to a downregulation of the cell’s defence system.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">The Housewarming Party</h2>
                        <p>Once the virus has taken over host translation it starts extensively remodeling the cell to its needs. At this point, the infected cell fuses with neighboring cells that express ACE2, developing into massive individual respiratory cells filled with up to 20 nuclei. Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 transforms the long, thin endoplasmic reticulum (ER) into double-membrane spheres.</p>
                        <p>These double-membrane vesicles (DMV’s) provide a safe place for viral RNA to be replicated and translated and appear to be the primary – if not exclusive – sites of RNA synthesis.</p>
                        <p>Before the assembled virus leave the host cell, a host protein called furin recognizes and clips a string of five amino acids on the virus. The furin cut loosens up virion spike proteins so that they respond to TMPRSS2 enzyme while entering a new host. If spikes are not pre-clipped by furin, they bypass TMPRSS2, and enter through less efficient, slower pathways, if at all.</p>
                        <p>For years, evidence has suggested that coronaviruses are transported out of the cell through the Golgi complex, where they form a lipid envelope from the Golgi complex’s membrane. However, recent research indicates that these newly formed coronaviruses leave the cell through lysosomes.</p>

                        <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has been ongoing for nearly 3 years now. As of January 2023, the pandemic had caused 6.7 million deaths, making it one of the deadliest in history.</p>
                        <p>Regardless of the flattening covid curve, the constant spawning of the variants and the perseverance of this disease would suggest that despite best efforts, Covid-19 could be here to stay. For me, I feel that covid has permeated my life; washing hands is a mania and wearing masks is second nature. And for now, it is best that we remember that the most dangerous virus is a negative mindset, and continue fighting against the ones we know.</p>
