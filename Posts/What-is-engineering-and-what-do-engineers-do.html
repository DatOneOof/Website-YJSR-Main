                        <p style="text-align: center">Let's explore the fascinating world of engineering!</p>
                        
                        <p>Engineers are responsible for creating most of the products we use today, such as mobile phones, TVs, laptops, printers, and chargers. They possess problem-solving skills honed through mathematical training, which forms the foundation of engineering along with other subjects.<br><br>

                        Engineers are equipped to solve problems by receiving a problem statement and devising solutions. This incredible feat is accomplished not by a single engineer but by a team of engineers working together.<br><br>

                        Consider the invention of mobile phones as an example. A team of engineers recognized the challenge of connecting people around the world and enabling communication with loved ones, family members, and colleagues who may be on the other side of the globe. They perceived this as a problem and developed the solution of creating mobile phones.<br><br>

                        Reginald Aubrey Fessenden, an Electrical Engineer and founder, achieved a groundbreaking milestone by creating the first wireless telephone device. He successfully transmitted a human voice over a distance of 1.6 km (one mile) using amplitude modulation, a technique that modifies the height of a wave to convey information, similar to adjusting the volume of a radio wave to transmit sound.<br><br>

                        Now that you have gained an engineer's perspective, you have the ability to transform your ideas into reality. With further learning and upskilling, you can materialize whatever you desire. How amazing is that?<br><br>

                        Let's delve into ten types of engineering, but keep in mind that this is not an exhaustive list: </p>
