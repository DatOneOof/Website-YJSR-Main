                        <p>Hydrogen fuel cell cars are powered by an electric motor and are therefore classified as e-cars. The common abbreviation is FCEV, short for “Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle,” in contrast to a BEV or “Battery Electric Vehicle.”</p>
                        <p>Fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) have the potential to significantly reduce our dependence on foreign oil and lower harmful emissions that contribute to climate change.</p>
                        <p>FCVs run on hydrogen gas rather than gasoline and emit no harmful tailpipe emissions. Several challenges must be overcome for them to be competitive with conventional vehicles, but their potential benefits are substantial.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">History</h2>
                        <p>Proton exchange membrane fuel cells were first used by NASA in the 1960’s as part of the Gemini space program, and were used on seven missions. Those fuel cells used pure oxygen and hydrogen as the reactant gases and were small scale, expensive and not commercially viable. NASA’s interest pushed further development, as did the energy crisis in 1973. Since then, fuel cell research has continued unabated and fuel cells have been used successfully in a wide variety of applications.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Energy Transformation</h2>
                        <p>When used as an electrical energy generating device, fuel cells require fewer energy transformations than those associated with a heat engine. When used as a mechanical energy generating device, fuel cells require an equal number of conversions, although the specific transformations are different.</p>
                        <p>Every energy transformation has an associated energy loss so that the fewer transformations there are, the better the efficiency. Thus fuel cells are more ideally suited to applications that require electrical energy as the end product, rather than mechanical energy. Comparative energy transformations for fuel cells, batteries and heat engines are shown in <span class="internal-link" onclick="document.getElementsByClassName('illus-img')[1].scrollIntoView()">below figure</span>.</p>
                        <img class="illus-img" src="../assets/others/hydrogen_powered_car_harya (3).jpg">
                        <p class="img-cap">Figure 2</p>
                        <p>A fuel cell is an energy conversion device that converts the chemical energy of a fuel directly into electricity without any intermediate thermal or mechanical processes. Energy is released whenever a fuel reacts chemically with the oxygen in air. In an internal combustion engine, the reaction occurs combustively and the energy is released in the form of heat, some of which can be used to do useful work by pushing a piston. In a fuel cell, the reaction occurs electrochemically and the energy is released as a combination of low-voltage DC electrical energy and heat.</p>
                        <p>The electrical energy can be used to do useful work directly while the heat is either wasted or used for other purposes. In galvanic cells <i>(i.e. - An electrochemical cell that converts the chemical energy of spontaneous redox reactions into electrical energy)</i>, electrochemical reactions form the basis in which chemical energy is converted into electrical energy. A fuel cell of any type is a galvanic cell, as is a battery. In contrast, in electrolytic cells, electrical energy is converted into chemical energy, such as in an electrolyzer or electroplater. A basic feature of fuel cells is that the electric current load determines the consumption rate of hydrogen and oxygen. In an actual systems application, a variety of electrical loads may be applied to the fuel cell.</p>
                        <p>In principle, a fuel cell can operate using a variety of fuels and oxidants. Hydrogen has long been recognized as the most effective fuel for practical fuel cell use since it has higher electrochemical reactivity than other fuels, such as hydrocarbons or alcohols. Even fuel cells that operate directly on fuels other than hydrogen tend to first decompose into hydrogen and other elements before the reaction takes place. Oxygen is the obvious choice of oxidant due to its high reactivity and its abundance in air. Below is the diagram of working of a fuel cell.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Comparison of Fuel Cells with Batteries</h2>
                        <p>Fuel cells and batteries are both galvanic cells and therefore have many similarities. Both fuel cells and batteries consist of an anode and a cathode in contact with an electrolyte. Both devices generate electrical energy by converting chemical energy from a high energy state to a lower energy state using an electrochemical reaction. Fuel cells differ from batteries in the nature of their anode and cathode.</p>
