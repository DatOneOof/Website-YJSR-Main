                        <p>Einstein's 1915 theory of general relativity states that gravity is not a force but a curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. This curvature can be considered a warp in the fabric of spacetime that can cause objects to follow curved paths <sup>(2)</sup>. Einstein's theory predicted the existence of black holes, areas in space where the force of gravity is so strong that even light cannot escape it.</p>
                        <p>When stars that are at least 10 to 15 times bigger than the sun run out of thermonuclear fuel, they explode in a supernova, forming black holes. These black holes are created from a core with an extremely strong gravitational force, causing the star to collapse in on itself. The star eventually contracts to the point of zero volume and infinite density, creating what is referred to as a "singularity," over time. The singularity has such a strong gravitational pull that the curvature of light is bent around it, depriving it of all light. This is why it is called a "black hole" <sup>(1)</sup>.</p>
                        <p>Black holes were postulated in 1915, but they were not seen until 1971 when a team of astronomers under the direction of Charles Townes found Cygnus X-1 <sup>(3)</sup>. The theory of wormholes was not directly influenced by the discovery of black holes. However, the general relativity mathematics that led to the discovery of black holes also made theoretic wormholes possible. White holes are the time-reversed counterparts of black holes, according to Austrian physicist Ludwig Flamm's 1916 theory. According to his hypothesis, a space-time conduit could link black and white holes. However, since they defy the second law of thermodynamics, white holes are thought to be nonexistent.</p>
                        <p>Karl Schwarzschild found the first precise solution to Albert Einstein's equations just a few months after he published his theory of general relativity. One of the fascinating predictions of Schwarzschild's solution was that if a mass, M, were to be compressed within a critical radius, R s, now known as the Schwarzschild radius, its gravity would become so intense that not even light could escape <sup>(4)</sup>. This is what we now call a black hole.</p>
                        <p>In 1935, Einstein and physicist Nathan Rosen developed this idea using the general theory of relativity and the Einstein-Rosen bridges.  The idea of Einstein-Rosen bridges, also known as wormholes, is derived from the equations of general relativity <sup>(1)</sup>. Wormholes are believed to be spacetime passageways that, if they could be crossed, could serve as a kind of portal from one place to another. However, in 1962, it was discovered that traversable wormholes are only something of science fiction and that the mechanics of a wormhole are so unstable that it would collapse far too quickly for anything, even a single photon, to travel through it.  The only way a traversable wormhole could theoretically exist is if an unknown substance could resist gravity long enough to keep the wormhole open and allow travel through it. <sup>(5)</sup></p>
                        <p>This work led to the discovery of different kinds of wormholes: Lorentzian, Euclidean, and Schwarzchild. Lorentzian wormholes are the kind of wormholes you see on television in many science-fiction movies or comics. These wormholes are traversable because they utilise negative mass to stay open and stable for long enough so that something could travel through them. Negative mass is a hypothetical type of exotic matter. According to Newton’s Second Law of Motion, force is equal to the rate of change of momentum. Additionally, when an object is pushed, it accelerates in the direction it was pushed. However, when negative mass is pushed in one direction, it accelerates backwards. During a laser experiment, Prof. Engles and his colleagues discovered negative mass in cooled rubidium atoms <sup>(6)</sup>. The existence of negative mass could theoretically allow Lorentzian wormholes to exist, but the energy required to keep the wormhole open would still be insufficient.</p>
                        <p>
                            Lorentzian wormholes can be classified into two types <sup>(7)</sup>:

                            The most familiar type of geometry is Euclidean geometry. Geometry underpins our everyday experiences, such as measuring distances and drawing shapes. Because Euclidean geometry allows for the existence of shortcuts through spacetime, Euclidean wormholes are thought to be possible. Euclidean wormholes are characterized by two specific features <sup>(7)</sup>:
                            <ol class="cont-list">
                                <li>They have two asymptotically flat regions linked to two different points in spacetime. As a result, they may be used to travel between different points in our universe.</li>
                                <li>They have a narrow throat, which is a region with a very high spacetime curvature. This means that the laws of physics may be different in the throat than in the rest of spacetime.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </p>
                        <p>The throat of the Euclidean wormhole, like the Lorentzian wormhole, is stabilized by exotic matter. Exotic matter is a substance that weighs less than nothing. Instead of being pushed away from gravity, it would be drawn toward it. This would allow wormholes and warp drives to exist.</p>
                        <p>Schwarzchild wormholes are based on the Schwarzchild solution to Einstein's general theory of relativity. They are distinguished by a single asymptotically flat region, implying that they are connected to a single region of spacetime. The throat of a Schwarzchild wormhole is extremely small, on the order of Planck length. The Planck length is the distance at which the laws of classical physics break down and quantum effects dominate. It is the smallest possible measurement of length that has any meaning and is about 10<sup>-35</sup> meters. This would shrink the wormhole to the size of any object we have ever detected, and not even a photon could pass through it. This means that it would be impossible to travel through a Schwarzschild wormhole without encountering exotic matter, which is a matter that has a negative energy density.</p>
                        <p>Despite all of the research, data, and theoretical models on Einstein-Rosen bridges, they have yet to be discovered. They are believed to be extremely small, extremely unstable, and extremely rare. However, some methods may be used to indirectly observe the effect or traces of wormholes in our universe, and this observational evidence will be analyzed in this paper. This observational evidence includes gravitational lensing, black hole mergers, quantum entanglement, cosmic microwave background radiation, and the expansion of the universe.</p>
                        <p><a href="./Gravitational-lensing-and-its-applications.html">Gravitational lensing</a> is a phenomenon that occurs when the gravity of massive objects bends the light of objects behind them. In 1919, Einstein made predictions that light would follow a curved path around massive objects. He proposed that the light from a star behind the sun would follow a curved path around the sun due to spacetime warping.  Arthur Eddington later proved this to be true when he observed the same star during a solar eclipse and discovered it in a different position. The above figure depicts the gravitational lensing trajectory, where R is the radius of the star, r<sub>0</sub> is the shortest distance to the star, b is the impact parameter, is the incident direction, n, and is the light deflection <sup>(10)</sup>.</p>

                            Over the many years of studying the sky, gravitational lensing has been a powerful tool for astronomers. It can be used to study the mass distributions and clusters of galaxies and measure the universe's expansion. Gravitational lensing can also be used to study the properties of dark matter, an abstruse substance that makes up approximately 85% of the matter in the universe. Gravitational lensing can be used to investigate the existence of wormholes in two ways: 
                            <ol class="cont-list">
                                <li><i>Strong gravitational lensing:</i> A large wormhole can create strong gravitational lensing effects, such as multiple images of the same object or an object being stretched or squeezed. If these effects are observed, it could be an indication that a wormhole is present.</li>
                                <li><i>Weak gravitational lensing:</i> Weak gravitational lensing can be used to study the mass distribution of galaxies and clusters of galaxies. A wormhole in a galaxy or cluster of galaxies could cause a small deviation in the mass distribution, which could be detected through weak gravitational lensing surveys.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </p>
                        <p>The flaw in this method of wormhole investigation is that it is difficult to tell whether the gravitational lensing is caused by black holes or wormholes, and it would only work on the premise that wormholes are large enough to cause gravitational lensing, which contradicts the laws of Schwarzchild's wormholes as stated on page five.</p>
                        <p>A team of researchers led by Lei-Hua-Liu, a physicist at Jishou University in China, created a simulation of an electrically charged, spherical wormhole <sup>(13)</sup>. The model proposed that wormholes, if they exist, could be detected using gravitational lensing and would produce different gravitational lensing effects than black holes. This model is still theoretical, and there is no direct evidence to back up its predictions. However, it is an intriguing possibility that could lead to new approaches to wormhole search.</p>
                        <p>Black hole mergers have also been used as indirect evidence of wormholes in some studies. <br>A black hole merger is a cosmic event that occurs when two black holes collide and merge into a single, supermassive black hole. Gravitational waves, which are ripples in spacetime caused by some of the most violent events in the universe, are thought to be a major source of black hole mergers. When two black holes merge, their gravitational fields interact, causing them to spiral towards each other. As they get closer, their gravity becomes stronger and stronger until they eventually collide and merge. The collision of two black holes is a high-energy event. It emits enormous amounts of energy in the form of gravitational waves, heat, and radiation <sup>(14)</sup>. The gravitational waves emitted by black hole mergers are powerful enough to be detected by gravitational wave observatories on Earth. A black hole merger has three major stages: inspiral, merger, and ringdown. Inspiral: The two black holes orbit each other, slowly approaching. The release of gravitational waves drives this stage. Merger: The two black holes collide and merge to form a single, larger black hole. This is the most energetic stage, producing the most powerful gravitational waves. Ringdown: After forming, a black hole settles into a stable shape through a process known as ringdown. During ringdown, any distortions in the black hole's shape are dissipated as gravitational waves <sup>(15)</sup>.</p>
                        <img class="illus-img" src="../assets/others/the_search_for_einstein_rosen_bridges_salma (2).png">
                        <p class="img-cap"><b>Figure 4</b></p>
                        <p>In theory, black hole mergers could be used to investigate the existence of wormholes. This is because gravitational waves emitted by black hole mergers may differ depending on whether they are caused by the merger of two black holes or the merger of a black hole and a wormhole. For example, if a black hole and a wormhole merged, the gravitational waves emitted could be stronger than the gravitational waves emitted by the merger of two black holes. This is due to the possibility that the wormhole could serve as a gravitational lens, enlarging the gravitational waves that the black hole emits. Additionally, the gravitational waves generated by the merger of a black hole and a wormhole may have a different frequency from those generated by the merger of two black holes. This is because the wormhole might affect how gravitational waves move through space.</p>
                        <p>Quantum entanglement is a further phenomenon investigated in the study of wormholes.  When two particles are connected in a way that makes them share information and remain connected regardless of how far apart they are, a quantum mechanical phenomenon known as quantum entanglement takes place. This means that even if two particles are billions of light-years apart if something bad happens to one of them, the other will immediately know about it. For many years, physicists have been perplexed by this extremely strange and counterintuitive phenomenon. Quantum entanglement has several possible explanations, but none of them has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. One hypothesis holds that the two particles are linked by a wormhole, a fictitious passageway that might unite two distinct locations in space. Another theory is that the two particles are the same particle split into two parts at the moment of creation.</p>
                        <img class="illus-img" src="../assets/others/the_search_for_einstein_rosen_bridges_salma (1).png">
                        <p class="img-cap"><b>Figure 5:</b> Similarites between structures of Wormholes and Quantum Entanglement Particles <sup>(18)</sup></p>
                        <p>Recently, physicists have been proposing the idea that wormholes are related to, or are a form of, quantum entanglement. If wormholes and quantum entanglement are indeed two sides of the same coin, it would mean that general relativity and quantum mechanics are not as incompatible as previously thought. This would be a breakthrough in physics, as it would provide a way to unify two of the most fundamental theories of our understanding of the universe.</p>
                        <p>One way these two phenomena may be related stems from Hawking's’ discovery of black hole radiation <sup>(17)</sup>. Stephen Hawkings’ discovery that black holes emit radiation changed the way we understand black holes. Previously, it was thought that nothing could escape the gravitational pull of a black hole. However, Hawking showed that quantum effects cause black holes to emit radiation in a way that is similar to how hot objects emit radiation. This radiation, known as Hawking radiation, has a temperature that is inversely proportional to the mass of the black hole. This conveys that the smaller the black hole, the hotter its Hawking radiation. Physicists have known since the 19th century that temperature is a property of the microscopic constituents of a system. To give an example, the temperature of a gas arises from the agitation of the molecules in the gas. Hawking radiation is thought to be emitted by quantum fluctuations in the vacuum state surrounding black holes. This conveys that if black holes have temperatures, they must also have microscopic constituents that can collectively adopt various possible configurations or microstates. In other words, black holes should be fundamentally probabilistic. This is a radical departure from the classical view of black holes as completely deterministic objects.</p>
                        <p>From the outside, black holes behave like ordinary quantum systems, so it is possible to consider entangled pairs of them. Imagine two black holes that are very far apart. Black holes are complex objects with a large number of possible quantum states. When two black holes are entangled, their quantum states are linked together in such a way that if we measure a certain state for one black hole, the other black hole must be in the same state. This is a strange and counterintuitive phenomenon, but it is one of the most fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics.</p>
                        <p>The existence of entangled pairs of black holes would have profound implications for our understanding of the universe. It would suggest that quantum entanglement is not limited to microscopic objects but can also exist between macroscopic objects. This would be a breakthrough in physics and would have a significant impact on our understanding of the nature of reality <sup>(17)</sup>.</p>
                        <p>CMB is another intriguing method of indirectly investigating the existence of wormholes. Cosmic microwave background radiation is a faint afterglow of the Big Bang. It provides us with important clues about its origin and evolution. The CMB is a thermal radiation field that fills the entire universe. It has a temperature of about 2.7 kelvin, which is just above absolute zero. The CMB is also very uniform, with only tiny variations in its temperature. Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson discovered the CMB for the first time in 1964. They were studying radio waves from the sky when they discovered a faint background of radiation coming from all directions. This radiation was later identified as the CMB. The discovery of the CMB was a cosmological breakthrough. It confirmed the Big Bang theory and gave us a way to study the early universe. The CMB has been used to calculate the expansion rate of the universe, its composition, and the presence of dark matter and dark energy <sup>(19)</sup>.</p>
                        <p>
                            The CMB can be scattered by wormholes in two ways:
                            <ol class="cont-list">
                                <li><b>Rayleigh scattering:</b> This is the most common type of scattering, and it occurs when radiation is scattered by small particles. In the case of the CMB, the particles that would scatter the radiation would be in the wormhole's throat. Rayleigh scattering would cause the CMB to be scattered in all directions, but it would not cause any distortion in the CMB radiation.</li>
                                <li><b>Mie scattering:</b> This type of scattering occurs when radiation is scattered by larger particles. In the case of the CMB, the particles that would scatter the radiation would be the wormhole's event horizon. Mie scattering would cause the CMB to be scattered in all directions, but it would also distort the CMB radiation.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </p>
                        <p>The distortion in the CMB radiation caused by Mie scattering would be unique to wormholes. This is because the event horizon of a wormhole has a specific shape that would cause the CMB radiation to be scattered in a specific way. Therefore, if this distortion were observed in the CMB radiation, it would be a strong indication of the existence of wormholes. However, it is important to note that the distortion caused by Mie scattering would be very small. It would be difficult to detect, even with the most sensitive CMB surveys. Therefore, it is unlikely that CMB scattering by wormholes will be used to definitively prove the existence of wormholes soon. Overall, CMB scattering by wormholes is a promising method for investigating the existence of wormholes. However, more research is needed to confirm whether or not this is a viable method.</p>
                        <p>Another way that wormholes could affect the expansion of the universe is by creating a region of space with negative curvature. This would cause the expansion of the universe in this region to accelerate, which could also be detectable. In general relativity, the curvature of spacetime is determined by the distribution of mass and energy. A region of space with negative curvature is one in which the total mass and energy are less than zero. This can happen if there is a wormhole present in the region. The presence of a wormhole would create an area of space with negative curvature. This would cause the expansion of the universe in this region to accelerate. This acceleration could be detected by observing the redshift of light from distant galaxies. The redshift of light is caused by the expansion of the universe.</p>
                        <p>When light travels through expanding space its wavelength is stretched which causes it to shift towards the red end of the spectrum. The expansion rate of the universe is proportional to the amount of redshift. If the expansion rate of the universe in a particular region is accelerating then the redshift of light from distant galaxies in that region will be greater than the redshift of light from distant galaxies in other regions. This difference in redshift could be used to detect the presence of a wormhole.</p>
                        <p>To conclude, there are a number of ways that physicists are investigating the existence of wormholes. Gravitational lensing, black hole mergers, quantum entanglement, and CMB scattering are all potential methods for detecting or indirectly inferring the existence of these exotic objects. While no definitive evidence of wormholes has yet been found, the search for these theoretical tunnels is an active area of research, and there is a growing body of evidence that suggests they may indeed exist.</p>
                        <p>The methods described above are all indirect methods of detecting wormholes. This means that they cannot definitively prove the existence of wormholes, but they can provide suggestive evidence. More research is needed to develop more direct methods of detecting wormholes. This could involve sending probes through regions of space where wormholes are thought to exist or using more sensitive instruments to detect the gravitational lensing effects of wormholes. The discovery of wormholes would have a profound impact on our understanding of the universe. Wormholes could potentially be used for faster-than-light travel or travel to other universes. They could also provide a way to unify general relativity and quantum mechanics. The search for wormholes is an exciting and challenging area of research. These exotic objects may exist, and if they do, they could open up a whole new realm of possibilities for our understanding of the universe.</p>
