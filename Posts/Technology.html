            <p>
              In the modern world, technology has made communication simpler,
              but at the sacrifice of face-to-face interaction. As this form of
              communication enables them to handle their own affairs, remain at
              home, and communicate with others who are hundreds of miles away,
              more and more people are choosing to engage from home in front of
              a computer screen. However, a lot of people start utilising
              technology for communication before they really need to. In
              actuality, people forgo face-to-face engagement in favour of using
              technology for communications. Information technologies and
              various forms of distant communication have made it possible to
              communicate with people who are far away, but many people abuse
              this type of communication and forgo crucial personal
              interactions.
            </p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">
              Technologies facilitate communication:-
            </h2>
            <p>
              Technology and culture are two particular factors that affect how
              people communicate. Interpersonal communication, small-group
              communication, organisational communication, mass communication,
              and public communication are the six basic categories of
              communication where innovative technologies are used. These types
              can work together and none of them exist alone.
            </p>
            <p>
              Prior until a few years ago, it is clear that each of these forms
              of communication had its limitations due to personal contact,
              telephone discussions when a person's mobility was restricted, and
              written correspondence. Nowadays, people may use the Internet to
              speak information, making communication at each of these levels
              easier. For instance, a corporation shouldn't call everyone
              together to deliver a single, straightforward announcement.
            </p>
            <p>
              All workers' emails only need to be sent via corporate email.
              Prior to the ability to deliver messages via information
              technology, public and organisational borders in communication
              were the most difficult to navigate. Managers of organisations are
              not required to limit their work and tell their subordinates. It
              is possible to set up a video conference or send a message so that
              everyone in the meeting can voice their opinions. It is simple
              since people can go more quickly. Additionally, all the necessary
              tools are still available.
            </p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">
              Technologies create complication in communication :-
            </h2>

            <p>
              The internet, together with a number of supplementary programmes
              and software, has improved and built a good foundation for remote
              communication. Despite being based on an overly complicated
              programme and domain, the Internet has in no way made
              communication simpler. People may communicate with each other
              regardless of where they are thanks to tools like ICQ, Skype,
              Facebook, and other similar services.
            </p>
            <p>
              The communications are now simpler, quicker, and more practical
              thanks to all of these services. Through online communication,
              people have the chance to consider their responses before acting.
              Additionally, a choice might be made later on after consulting
              something or someone online. Therefore, it is possible to assert
              that online communication enables people to make well-considered
              decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Due to certain factors, online communication is also an excellent
              way to stay in touch with those who are far away. In addition,
              because of the technology's ability to send both speech and video,
              it is also feasible to view friends and family members. Isn't it
              wonderful to have a sense of proximity to those who live thousands
              of kilometres away?
            </p>
            <p>
              Since people are social beings, they require personal contact in
              order to feel other people's touch, observe other people's
              gestures, etc. Written communication cannot convey intonation or
              convey how people are responding to what is being spoken.
              Communication becomes more challenging as a result; occasionally,
              people are unable to comprehend one another and must repeat
              themselves, which takes too much time.
            </p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion:-</h2>
            It follows that even if new technology have made communication more
            convenient in terms of place and time, people still experience
            problems with it. Online communication lacks the intonation and
            mimicry that are crucial in real-world talks. People don't actually
            communicate in ways they have to these days, despite the paradox
            that it has gotten easier and faster. They appear to communicate
            facts without emotion. Smiles and other graphic images are used to
            replace the reaction, which does not accurately represent the true
            feelings. Additionally, since they are not required to express their
            response, they may not feel any feelings.
