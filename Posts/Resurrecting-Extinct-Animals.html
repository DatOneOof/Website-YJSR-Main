                        <p>With recent discussions on the usage of how to expend money on biotechnology, the consensus is to right one of humanity’s pitfalls: resurrecting extinct animals with cloning. However, to ignore the current animal species on the brink of extinction, but rather on extinct species with low prospects of surviving in our contemporary world  is not only unethical but irrational. <br><br>It would be the best and worst decision the scientific world could ever accomplish.  Not only would this feat isolate extinct animals from the entire world because of evolution but also put a target on them.  
<br><br>
As time moves forward, evolution moves even faster.  Even current animals struggle to adapt now because of climate change. Now de-extinct animals would struggle to keep up and would need to be rehabilitated. Their diets and ways of life would not be feasible in today’s ecosystems. In order to accommodate, these animals would be in labs and regularly be monitored. 
<br><br>
Unfortunately, their well-being would not be considered because of their value. If an animal who virtually didn’t exist for centuries came back, its rarity would skyrocket. Furthermore, these extinct species would become subject to entertainment. Only the top 1% of society would have access to this biotechnology. The current scene for cloning of cats and dogs costs thousands of dollars. Viagen, an US pet cloning facility, charges over $50,000 to further the bond with the owner and late pet. This is just for one dog or cat. Imagine the cost to bring back a whole species. Once these animals would be exposed to the public and be put in zoos for entertainment. In addition, if these animals were released  into the wild instead of zoos , their likelihood of survival is considerably low.  
<br><br>
Domesticated animals can not fend for themselves. It would be the same effect of putting a rabbit into a wolf's den and expecting it to survive. It is simply not possible. In addition, these de-extinct species are now the hottest things on the market.  The black market for exotic animals would set their sights on these de-extinct species without regulation. 
<br><br></p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Why Not “Rectify” the Crimes of Humanity</h2>

                        <p>
Due to human efforts, many animal species were wiped out from existence. Such as a Dodo bird or Wooly Mammoth. So many believe that using biotechnology can fix the mistakes of the past. However, to bring extinct animals back would expose them to our current ecosystems. Right now, many animal species are either endangered or  going extinct or facing obstacles because of invasive species. In addition some species are facing obstacles because of global warming because of the overexposure of fossil fuels.  Many of these  obstacles are due to human actions.  Humans, good faith, cannot bring these extinct animals back just to put them in ruined ecosystems. It could have dangerous effects on their health. We do not know what these animals, whichever method we use to bring them back,  have since they existed hundreds or even thousands of years ago. At the time, researchers were debating whether cloning produces animals that age faster or have higher risks of disease compared to their cell donor. An example of this is the first cloned dog and cloned animal.  After the  experiments, Dolly died at 6, around half the age of the average sheep, from lung disease and arthritis; Snuppy died of the same cancer that had killed Tai at age 12. (Brogan 2018) This happened in a controlled setting. Imagine one from centuries ago. This could endanger current animal species and they can struggle to adapt. to our new ever-changing contemporary world.
<br><br>
Several supportive discussions for extinct species consider the well-being and survivability of the extinct species. One of the most highly resonating criticisms of de-extinction is the perspective that, at such a price, the goals do not justify the means, and urgent initiatives to save extant species or maintain ecosystems should be prioritized before the resurrection of the extinct (Yule 2002;Fletcher 2008;Sandler 2014). Biotechnology should  be used only to prevent current animal species from going extinct. Focusing on expending on resurrecting extinct animals is not only a waste of resources but also time.</p>
