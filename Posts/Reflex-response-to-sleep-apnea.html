                        <h2 class="section-heading">What is Sleep Apnea?</h2>
                        <p>Sleep Apnea is one of the most common sleep disorders. It is very fatal, and occurs due to the lack of oxygen to the brain. This lack of oxygen is usually from your airway being blocked. Your body is most vulnerable when you are asleep, which can lead to fatal accidents if sleep apnea occurs. During episodes, the muscles that support the soft tissue in your mouth relax, close your airway, and prevent normal breathing patterns. In the medical world, lack of oxygen to the tissues is known as hypoxia. Vice versa, hypoxemia is known as low oxygen levels in the blood.</p>
                        <p>To date, there are many researchers conducting treatments and clinical trials to study new and innovative ways to aid the effects of sleep apnea on the body, and ways to prevent hypoxia/hypoxemia. Most of the treatments that are currently being studied aim to keep the airway open and prevent relaxation in the muscles. One of the more well-known treatments available for patient use is a CPAP machine, which blows constant pressurized air to prevent the collapse of the airway during hours of sleep. The use of a CPAP machine can run the average person between $250-$1,000. Of course, if covered by insurance, it could be less or none at all.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">How can you find out if you are suffering from Sleep Apnea?</h2>
                        <p>There are many ways to diagnose sleep apnea professionally, but the most common is through the home sleep test. During this test, your blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen level, and breathing patterns are monitored through a portable device. The doctor then analyzes this data and gives you a diagnosis based on whether your sleep apnea is one of three categories: obstructive, central, or complex.</p>
                        <p>Obstructive sleep apnea is when there is an obstruction in your airway. This can be caused by an obstruction such as your tongue in the way of your breathing, when muscles relax inappropriately. Central sleep apnea is when your brain does not send the proper signals to your body. Lastly, complex sleep apnea is a mix of both obstructive and central sleep apnea. In most cases, this isn’t as concerning because typically it is just diagnosed as obstructive sleep apnea.</p>
                        <p>If you are truly concerned about developing sleep apnea, your neck may be a valuable clue. For men, if your neck is larger than 17 inches wide this could indicate that you may have a more narrow airway, which makes it more likely for an obstruction to occur. For women, if your neck is larger than 15 inches wide, this could again indicate a narrow airway. Sleep Apnea is also hereditary, which means that it could be genetically passed down. It is important to note these risk factors of sleep apnea, because it can lead to the decrease of oxygen to your brain, cause memory fragmentation, and daytime drowsiness.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>Each type of sleep apnea has slightly different effects on the body. It is important to watch out for these signs. If you are concerned or have developed any signs of sleep apnea, please see a healthcare professional.</p>
