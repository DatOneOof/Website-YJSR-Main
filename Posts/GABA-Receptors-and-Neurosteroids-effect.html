                        <h2 class="section-heading">Abstract</h2>
                        <p>Psychiatric disorders are major causes of death in the U.S. Multiple current treatments, including medications and psychotherapy, are effective but have a &frac13; fail rate, meaning that the methods don’t alleviate their disorders (Dryden, 2018). However, a new approach has been discovered. Recent research and investigations in the field of psychiatric medicine have been tailored to focus on the effects of a new class of antidepressants, neuroactive steroids. They have been shown to have potential to treat various psychological disorders, such as major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and postpartum depression. Neuroactive steroids have shown to increase the binding to GABA receptors (Zorumski et al., 2019). The effects of SGE-217 (zuranolone) as well as its effects coupled with DZP are shown to be synergistic.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>GABA is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter of the central nervous system. It modulates neuronal activity in the brain. In relation, disorders are caused by too much neuronal activity, or overstimulation, or by the lack of inhibition of neuronal activity. Neuroactive steroids act as positive allosteric modulators. Neuroactive steroids bind with both synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA receptors, meaning that they enhance their signaling (Althaus et al., 2020). GABA receptors help slow down the cognitive processes that lead to thoughts and feelings correlating with anxiety and depression. Since extrasynaptic and synaptic GABA receptors are thought of as potential targets for depression, many scientists have been developing compounds, or neuroactive steroids, tailored to bind to these specific receptors to increase binding of GABA to these receptors (Zorumski et al., 2019). The neuroactive steroids’ molecular structure allows them to bind with the GABA receptor, resulting in the decrease or increase of neuronal activity.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Methods</h2>
                        <p>According to a chapter from the journal, <i>Neurobiology of Stress</i>, zuranolone has the potential to be an effective clinical neuroactive steroid, used as a potential allievator for multiple psychiatric disorders- i.e depression and postpartum depression. Research from Althaus et al.(2020) supports this claim. An experiment called the acute hippocampal slice recording, or brain slice experiment, showcased recovered brain slices exposed to 0.1 or 1 &mu;M of an NAS for 15 min. So, in this experiment, SGE-217, or zuranolone, caused the GABA currents to increase, indicating its ability to protect against multiple disorders, because as zuranolone is binding to the GABA receptor, the neuronal excitation is increasing, as we can see in the graph to the right. In the graph, the solid black line shows the response of the delta subunit of the GABA receptor to GABA concentration without the presence of NAS. The response of the delta subunit reaches a fractional response of 0.5 at a GABA concentration of about 5 &mu;M, shown by the solid black line. The response of the delta subunit of the GABA receptor to the GABA concentration with the presence of  a NAS reaches a higher fractional response, as shown by the dotted black line. The similar pattern is repeated in the gamma subunit, shown by the solid and dotted red lines. Since the graph shows growth, or the increase of the GABA currents, its therapeutic ability to treat mood disorders is shown.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>However, zuranolone isn’t the only steroid in play here. Zuranolone is an allosteric modulator, and so, that means that it either produces additive or synergistic effects on receptor and neuronal activity. NASs bind to a subunit of the GABA receptors, whereas a type of diazepam (DZP) binds to the interface of another subunit. If these 2 compounds could potentially interact, then their molecular structure would help enhance the receptor function and current flow (Althaus et al., 2020). In an experiment, one type of receptor had 100 &mu;M of DZP added to it, as well as the zuranolone, which increased GABA current flow by 104%. The response curve shifted to the left, as we can see in the graphs to the right, and the maximum potentiation of zuranolone increased from 511% to 1084% (Althaus et al., 2020). Analyzing this experiment, coapplying both zuranolone and DZP meant that they acted synergistically to enhance receptor activity.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>In conclusion, the molecular structure of multiple neurosteroids allows them to bind with GABA receptors and their subunits, which can alleviate the effects of various psychiatric disorders. The experiments presented in this paper prove that neuroactive steroids can revolunzie treatment in the field of psychiatry. The research presented in this paper is cohesive and informative. However, they do have some forms of bias that should be addressed before we conclude. In <i>Announcing the novel class of GABA–A receptor selective positive allosteric modulator antidepressants</i>, it wasn’t specified that the data was peer reviewed, and if peer review experiments were done by credible scientists and with multiple experiments.  Also, in the <i>New approach to developing antidepressants</i> article, there is informational bias shown. There are gaps in the theories behind CRISPR technology that could act as an allosteric modulator; it seems under researched when compared to the other theories present in the article. All forms of bias need to be addressed. Going back to the experiments presented in the paper, the &frac13; fail rate for medication of depression, anxiety disorder, and bipolar disorder will decrease if we start implementing these neuroactive steroids shown in the data. The lives we can save are worth it.</p>

                            <i>Bias Addressed: The following sources that have documented the clinical testing of these neurosteroids are </i>
                            <ol>
                                <li><i>Neurosteroids as novel antidepressants and anxiolytics: GABA-A receptors and beyond</i>, which is a section of the journal, the <i>Neurobiology of Stress</i>.</li>
                                <li><i>Preclinical characterization of zuranolone (SAGE-217), a selective neuroactive steroid GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulator</i>, which is part of the journal, <i>Neuropharmacology</i>.</li>
                                <li><i>Announcing the novel class of GABA–A receptor selective positive allosteric modulator antidepressants.</i></li>
                                <li><i>New approach to developing antidepressants.</i></li>
                            </ol>
                            These sources are the ones with the most information, but a couple of them present some forms of bias, which needs to be addressed. In the <i>New approach to developing antidepressants</i> article, its target audience is the general public, not a scientific audience. Its purpose is to explain the function of GABA receptors and introduce the new approach, and the first two sources listed dive deeper into that topic. Both <i>Neurosteroids as novel antidepressants and anxiolytics: GABA-A receptors and beyond and Preclinical characterization of zuranolone (SAGE-217), a selective neuroactive steroid GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulator</i> are peer-reviewed, unbiased, and are in two very informative journals, as mentioned above.
