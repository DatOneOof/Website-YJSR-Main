                        <p>Whether evolution is a theory or a law is an issue that often confuses many, because these concepts may seem to have very close scientific meanings.  A theory is an explanation supported by "a substantial amount of evidence", while a law is a set of regularities that can be explained "in mathematical terms".  This is why Newton's Laws of Motion are referred to as laws, not theories, and are expressed in simple equations, eg f = ma for the 2nd Law of Motion.  The essence of evolution and biology often cannot be expressed in a mathematical equation, so it is called a theory.  A scientific law is not "better" or "more accurate" than a scientific theory.  A law explains what will happen under certain conditions, while a theory explains how it happens.  In the words of Biology Professor Kenneth R. Miller: “In fact, theory in science is at a higher level of understanding than laws. Because theories explain facts, they unify truths.”  The Law of Evolution reveals that living things change over generations, adapt to their environment, and that some traits are inherited to future generations.  How is the diversification revealed by this law, what are the ways, mechanisms that provide the said change, diversification and speciation?<br><br>
The answers to these questions vary according to different evolutionary theories explaining the law of evolution.  According to Darwin's "Natural Selection Theory", which is one of the most well-known theories today, there is a constant change, transformation and variation in the nature of living things.  All living things descend from the same common ancestor;  earlier simple species evolve slowly and in a straight line over long periods of time, turning into more advanced species.  In Darwin's theory of evolution, the mechanisms that ensure this change and variation are grouped under the title of the law of natural selection.  This change takes place through the law of natural selection, which is the expression of the principle of such a wide variety (variation) in nature, the survival of the one who adapts the most (adaptation) to the conditions and gains the most ability to reproduce over time (war for existence).  The principles of natural selection suggest that any trait that helps an individual survive long enough to produce offspring, whether reptile, plant, bird, or human, will be passed on disproportionately to subsequent generations.  Given enough time, the offspring of such organisms can diversify, occupying different environmental niches and evolving into new species.  Darwin expressed his thoughts as: "While this planet revolves around according to the fixed law of gravity, from such a simple beginning the most beautiful and wonderful endless forms have evolved and are evolving." .<br><br>
The Selfish Gene Theory, in which Richard Dawkins clarifies the law of evolution, specifically focuses on the ways in which genes or very small but significant pieces of inheritance can be transmitted in a variable environment in the long term, or succumb to history.  According to the "gene is selfish" theory, Darwin's theory of evolution should not be thought of as a struggle for survival of species or individuals, but as a struggle between genes.  From this perspective, the sole purpose of existence of the physical and behavioral traits that emerged in the evolutionary process is to facilitate the survival and spread of the genes that made them possible.  In this respect, what matters most is the extent to which genes can replicate themselves, thanks to their physical characteristics. Every living organism consists of a body that thinks completely of itself, that is, allows these "selfish" genes to spread. In other words: "We are no different from robots programmed to protect selfish molecules called genes".<br><br>
Another theory that attempts to clarify the law of evolution, the Red Queen Theory, arose when Leigh Van Valen argued that continuous improvement is required just to maintain fitness with respect to the systems with which it co-evolved.  Accordingly, for any species, no matter how sophisticated and superior the equipment for survival may be by natural selection, the rival species somehow continues to compete by responding to it with the same selection, and as a result, the increase in equipment and specialization cannot turn into a net profit for any of the competing species.  This competition can also be used for a certain resource (light, food, mate, habitat) among individuals belonging to the same species.  Another point highlighted by the theory emphasizes the importance of sex in living things.  In order to understand this theory, which links the evolutionary process in living things to sexes and sexual selection, it is necessary to understand the high cost of sex.  In most sexual species, males make up half the population, but do not directly give birth to offspring and generally contribute little to the survival of the offspring.  In birds and mammals, males help protect females, assisting offspring and mates in different ways, but sexual reproduction is much more common in simpler life forms where males have nothing to do with their offspring.  Most of the invertebrate species are not reared by the parents, just like the larvae develop among the plankton. In addition, organisms expend abundant resources to attract and compete with the opposite sex.  For example, the brightly colored plumage of birds of paradise makes them more visible to predators, although they attract the opposite sex.  Therefore, sexual reproduction appears to be quite inefficient for many species.  The reason why sexual reproduction, which causes high costs, continues, is explained by the Red Queen Theory, by saying that this mixed inheritance increases genetic diversity in the population through sexual reproduction and provides a defensive "advantage" to the offspring.  This theory argues that few aspects of human nature can be understood apart from sex because human nature is a product of evolution, and in our case evolution is driven by sexual selection. It argues that human intelligence is also largely the product of sexual selection, and that intelligence is used to attract mates through displays of attractiveness, creativity, and individuality.<br><br>
Stephen Jay Gould's Punctuated Equilibrium Theory, on the other hand, proposes that change does not occur in a smooth and gradual manner, but in a punctuated or episodic manner.  Gould et al., as a result of their studies, stated that two important facts of the fossil record, the geological sudden emergence of new species and subsequent periods of long-term stability, reflect the predictions of evolutionary theory, not the deficiencies and imperfections in the fossil record, as in Darwinian theory.  During periods of "stagnation" or "slowdown", which sometimes last for millions of years, only very little evolutionary change has occurred, living things generally remain "stationary", rapid speciation and branching events are very rare;  however, he argues that the main evolutionary changes occur in certain populations relatively quickly, over a short period of time, at times of significant environmental change.  Because the change of species is not just the accumulation of small quantitative features, these quantitative changes lead to qualitative leaps.  That is, nature advances in discontinuous leaps.  When the records are examined, it is clearly seen that new species emerged very rapidly in certain periods. For example, all the ancestors of today's animals emerged in a very short geological time, such as a few million years in the Cambrian period.  This theory describes the evolutionary process as a gradual process in which one species splits into two different species, rather than gradually transforming into another.<br><br>
In the words of S. J. Gould, “Our confidence in evolution is based on three general pieces of evidence.  First;  We have abundant direct and observational evidence of evolution in action, both outside and inside the laboratory.  Our second piece of evidence is the evolutionary explanation of nature's imperfection.  If we didn't all inherit from a common ancestor, why would a mouse run, a bat fly, a porpoise swim, and write this article with structures built from the same bones?  An engineer could have designed more suitable hands and feet for each of us.  The third piece of evidence is more direct: transitions from one state to another are often found in the fossil record.”  In order to understand the mechanism of the evolutionary process, many studies have been carried out over the years and numerous theories have been put forward.  Each of these theories examines different laws of nature (for example, the law of Natural Selection or the law of Sexual Selection) and offers explanations that combine them with other laws.  Among these explanations, there have been theories that have been refuted or developed over time, and such theories are expected to increase by diversifying.  However, just as a theory will not become a law when proven, the refutation or proliferation of these theories does not change the existence of the Law of Evolution.  Evolution is a statement of fact: The gene and trait distributions of living populations must change over generations.  Evolution is a law of nature.  It exists regardless of our understanding of it, works and changes living things.  Evolution will continue to exist whether we study it or not.<br><br>
