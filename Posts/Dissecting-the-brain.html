                        <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>The brain, first introduced in the Edwin Smith Surgical Papyrus in the 17th century, is arguably the most important organ in the human body. Over the years, the complexity of the brain has made it difficult to study. Whether you are a science-lover, neurologist, or someone who does not find interest in science at all, it is crucial to understand the multiple functions of the brain. Everything we have ever analyzed, said, felt, or thought- we owe it all to our brains.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">What is our brain made of and what does it look like?</h2>
                        <p>The human brain contains cells, arterioles, arteries, and nerve fibers. With 60% of the brain consisting of fat, the brain can be said to be the “fattiest” organ of the body. A fully developed adult brain is about three pounds, whereas a newborn baby’s brain may weigh three-quarters of a pound. It is a pinkish-grayish color, with many curved lines that appear like wrinkles. Referred to as gyrus and sulcus, the gyri and sulci found in the brain are indentations that cause the wrinkles. Although these grooved lines seem insignificant, they actually separate different lobes of the brain and divide it into two hemispheres: the left hemisphere and the right hemisphere.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">The Left Hemisphere</h2>
                        <p>According to Nobel Prize winner, Roger W. Sperry, the left hemisphere is responsible for a multitude of things such as: logic, linear thinking, facts, sequencing, mathematics, and thinking in words. In contrast to the right hemisphere, the left hemisphere is more orderly and analytical. If one is said to be “left-brained,” it means that they possess characteristics of objectiveness and neatness. Portrayed in various infographics, the left hemisphere of the brain is depicted as “dull” and “serious”. Interestingly, the left hemisphere of the human brain controls the right side of the body, whereas the right side of the brain will control the left side.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">The Right Hemisphere</h2>
                        <p>Known as the creative side of our brains, the right hemisphere is accredited for multiple functions such as recognizing faces, expressing emotions, using imagination and creating music. If one is said to be “right-brained,” it means that they are creative, subjective, intuitive, and emotional. Images and infographics often portray the right hemisphere with color, music and the arts.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Separating the Brain into Sections</h2>
                        <p>The brain has four main different lobes that all play a key role in understanding its function. These lobes are the Parietal Lobe, the Occipital Lobe, the Temporal Lobe, and the Frontal Lobe. Aside from these important parts of the brain, it also consists of the cerebellum, the spinal cord, the medulla oblongata, and the pons.</p>
                        <h3>The Parietal Lobe</h3>
                        <p>Residing in the upper back skull near the parietal bone, the parietal lobe plays a significant role in our brains. The Sylvian fissure separates the Parietal Lobe from the temporal lobe, as the Parietal lobe sits directly above it. Divided into two hemispheres, the parietal lobe receives information from parts of our bodies. Obtaining this information, it then sends it to different parts of the brain for interpretation of sensory. Dealing with various sensory processes, some senses the parietal lobe aids in delivering is pressure, pain, and tension. The parietal lobe may also be accredited for determining which hand someone is dominant in. Dependent on which side of the parietal lobe is more active, you may be right handed, left handed, or ambidextrous.</p>
                        <h3>The Occipital Lobe</h3>
                        <p>The smallest of the lobes, the two occipital lobes (one for each hemisphere of the brain) sits just below the occipital bone. The several functions of the occipital lobe include: the perception of depth and distance, determination of color, recognition, movement, and memory information. Fun Fact: the occipital lobe is what allows humans to have “binocular vision”, due to the fact that the occipital lobe is located in both hemispheres and can receive visual information from the retinas.</p>
                        <h3>The Temporal Lobe</h3>
                        <p>Sitting at the bottom middle portion of the brain, the temporal lobe is the second largest lobe of the brain. Concentrated around auditory stimuli, emotions, and memories, the temporal lobe is important for various functions in the brain. Alongside aiding in selective hearing, and visual recognition, the temporal lobe is also responsible for understanding and analyzing language.</p>
                        <h3>The Frontal Lobe</h3>
                        <p>The frontal lobe, the biggest lobe in the human brain, is arguably the most important lobe in the brain. Located near the front of the head, the addition of the frontal lobe is relatively new to the structure of the brain. Many functions of the frontal lobe include: forming memories, forming personalities, limiting motor skills, comparing and classifying, and producing speech and language.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Damages to the Brain</h2>
                        <p>If severely injured, the lobes of the brain may be permanently damaged. Some effects of these damages can include, but are not limited to: personality changes, paralysis, impulsivity, and language and speech impediments.</p>
