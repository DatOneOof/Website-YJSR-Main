            <p>
              Have you ever heard about Nikola Tesla? If your answer is no, you
              are missing out on a lot. But do not worry, in this article, you
              will learn enough to be impressed by his intelligence.
            </p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">WHO IS NIKOLA TESLA?</h2>
            <p>
              Nikola Tesla is famous for his contributions to the alternative
              current (AC) electric supply system and engineering. However,
              Nikola Tesla fascinates people who believe in the power of the
              numbers and they will help them “manifest” their desires by his
              obsession to magnificence of numbers 3,6 and 9. In psychology,
              obsessive-compulsive disorder is sometimes defined as the disease
              of intelligent people losing their brilliance. Perhaps we can
              attribute Tesla’s intelligence to this, because he was right when
              he talked about electricity years before his contemporaries. What
              if the keys of the universe are hidden in the numbers of 3,6 and
              9? What if he is right about this too?
            </p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">THE MYSTIQUE OF NUMBERS</h2>
            <p>
              “As Nikola Tesla said, we are living in a place where numbers are
              real and alive. Numbers are not just representative symbols. The
              relationship between numbers is not random or man-made. But we
              will discover that they are actually the basics of everything that
              we will discover.” It has been attributed that Tesla said: “ If
              you only knew the magnificence of the numbers 3, 6 and 9, then you
              would have a key to the universe “. We cannot be sure if he
              actually said this phrase, but his obsession with numbers is a
              fact. What did they mean to him? Why are they so important? It has
              to do with complicated mathematics and human history. For example,
              when you repeatedly multiple 3 by 3 (3,9,27,81…) you will always
              end up with digits that sum up to 3 (3,9,9,18…). Similarly, when
              you multiply 6 by 3 (6, 18, 54, 162…), the digits also reduce to 3
              or multiples of 3 (6, 9, 9, 9, etc.). For 9, the pattern is even
              more intriguing. Multiplying 9 by 3 (9, 27, 81, 243…) also results
              in digits that sum to 9 (9, 9, 9, 9, etc.). Also in Fibonacci
              Sequence, which is a famous mathematical pattern, where each
              number is the sum of the two preceding ones (e.g., 0, 1, 1, 2, 3,
              5, 8, 13, and so on). Interestingly, when you create a pattern
              using the Fibonacci sequence and reduce the numbers to a single
              digit, it eventually repeats as 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 4, 3, 7, 1, 8,
              9, 8, 8, and so on. Notice how 3, 6, and 9 are prominently present
              and form a repeating cycle. Threes also appear in human history.
              Triangles have three sides which are the same with pyramids. The “
              Father, Son and Holy Ghost ” is just one of the examples of many
              trinities that have existed throughout human history. Tesla
              himself would emphasize the “ energy, frequency and vibration ”
              trifecta, which he thought held the “ secrets of the universe ”.
            </p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">MAGNIFICENCE OF NUMBER IN HIS LİFE</h2>
            <p>
              In his life, he also used them in various fields. He would walk
              three times around the block before entering. Also washed his
              dishes with 18 napkins (18 is divisible by 3,6 and 9 ). He also
              would stay in hotel rooms that had a room number divisible by
              three as the room #3327 New Yorker Hotel in January 1943, where he
              died.
            </p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">CONCLUSİON</h2>
            <p>
              Today Tesla’s mystical attachment to 3,6 and 9 has been used by
              millions around the world in social media platforms. Users are
              using the 3, 6, 9 method to manifest their ambitions and dreams
              into their lives. Actually it is easy to use this method, thanks
              to social media users, you only need to write what you want to
              manifest - it can be a new and healthy relationship or job, it is
              all about yourself - three times in morning, 6 times in afternoon
              and 9 times at night. As discussions, memes, and content circulate
              on these platforms, the mystique of these numbers endures,
              perpetuating interest and curiosity among a new generation. It may
              not be what Tesla actually talked about and obsessed over the 3,6
              and 9. But the evidence that his ideas have not dimmed.
