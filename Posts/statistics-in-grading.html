                        <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>There is a commonality on the day when students receive their marked tests or assignments. No, not the groans or signs of relief. Rather, the nagging, persistent question of “what was the average?”</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">The relationship between statistics and grades</h2>
                        <p>The typical correlation between grades and statistics is the mean, a number describing the average grade, or the median, a figure describing the middle of the data set. There is also range, the value obtained from subtracting the lowest score from the highest score. The mode also serves to indicate the most common score received. Many students value these statistical figures, especially the mean, as they indicate the difficulty of the course as well as personal achievement compared to other students. <br><br>However, teachers and school boards employ other statistics methods in grading which are known as distributions.</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Distributions and their hidden importance</h2>
                        <p>What are distributions? Simply put, distributions are graphs or visualizations of the scores attained by students. The y-axis represents the score attained, and the x-axis shows the quantity of students that attained that grade. The distribution most commonly found in test scoring is called the normal distribution.<br><br>The normal distribution, also known as a bell curve, is a statistical distribution that centers around the mean, the point with the largest number of scores. The majority of the data falls within one standard deviation, a measure of variation, of the mean, with progressively smaller percentages falling within two and three standard deviations from the mean. The curve is typically symmetrical around the mean.</p>
                        
                        <img src="../assets/others/stats-in-grading.png" class="illus-img">
                        
                        <p>The phenomena of normal distribution can be attributed to the central limit theorem: the distribution of the sample means of many independent and identically distributed random variables approaches a normal distribution. The central limit theorem essentially means that with many samples (from each class), usually a size of 25 or higher, the means of the samples generate a normal distribution if they are independent and identical. This is shown by the graph above as the majority of scores fall around the average and median, with fewer people scoring lower or higher than the average.</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">What do irregular distributions indicate?</h2>
                        
                        <p>While normal distributions are typical and common, it is not always the case. For example, the distributions could be skewed if they are not independent or lacking enough samples. Thus, the distributions would be varied on external factors. However, this information is still useful for teachers and students as it provides insight into the difficulty of the class, or even the possibility of cheating. </p>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Irregular distributions and terms used to describe them.</h2>
                        
                        <p>The first type of irregular distribution is left skewed, which means the majority of data points fall within the right side of data, and decreases in quantity at a ski-like slope to the left. This indicates that the test was relatively easy, as the majority of people scored higher. <br><br> The first type of irregular distribution is left skewed, which means the majority of data points fall within the right side of data, and decreases in quantity at a ski-like slope to the left. This indicates that the test was relatively easy, as the majority of people scored higher.<br><br>Another irregular distribution, perhaps the most important one in those of academic honesty is the “bimodal” distribution. This means that instead of one peak (mode), or one point of greatest quantity, there are instead two. What does this indicate? Well, it points to signs that people attained the test beforehand, or even cheated together. A bimodal distribution arises when variables are not independent (not normal distribution), thus providing evidence that the class cheated- that is if nothing can explain why one part of the class did better. Furthermore, the teacher can compare data with previous tests, and if there appears to be two different modes, it further evidences cheating.</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
                        
                        <p>Overall, statistics are not just limited to terms such as mean, median, mode, and range. They can take the form of graphs and be used to provide information upon the difficulty of the class and the possibility of cheating.</p>
