            <p>
              Although Parkinson’s disease does have genetic factors in the
              equation, it’s important not to discount the importance of the
              environment. Some see a link to environmental toxins like
              pesticides and heavy metals. In a world where these toxins are in
              abundance, it’s hard to not fear for our future health. However,
              direct, long-term exposure to these toxins doesn’t cause
              Parkinson’s disease on its own. In this comprehensive review, the
              changes in our brain as a result of long-term exposure to
              environmental toxins are thoroughly examined. How Parkinson’s
              disease develops as a result of these chemical changes is
              described in detail. Along with showing how the problem is
              created, this review offers a few solutions to the problem.
            </p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction and Background</h2>
            <p>
              Before we dive deeper, it’s important to understand what
              Parkinson’s disease is. Parkinson’s disease is a brain disorder
              that causes uncontrolled movements, such as shaking, stiffness,
              and tremors, difficulty with balance and coordination. Symptoms
              usually worsen over time as people may gradually have difficulty
              walking and talking. Other symptoms that can develop over time
              include mental and behavioral changes, depression, memory
              difficulties, sleep problems, and fatigue. People over 60 are the
              highest at-risk group. A notable cause of Parkinson’s disease is
              when nerve cells in the basal ganglia, an area of the brain that
              controls movement, are impaired and/or die. These neurons produce
              dopamine, so the death of these neurons leads to less dopamine
              being produced.
            </p>
            <p>
              Studies have shown that long-term exposure to toxins like
              pesticides/herbicides and Manganese and other metals has a
              correlation to developing Parkinson’s disease. However, there are
              other toxins that we should look out for like MPTP, which is known
              to cause parkinsonism, a syndrome similar to Parkinson’s disease.
              Another interesting finding is that Agent Orange, a toxin used in
              the Vietnam War, is something the US Department of Affairs
              associates with Parkinson’s disease even though there haven’t been
              many cases where long-term exposure to Agent Orange has led to
              development of the brain disorder. The list of toxins that have
              already caused or may cause Parkinson’s disease is long and is
              always developing. Therefore, this review will focus on only a few
              of these toxins.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Review</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Pesticides</strong> <br />
              Many pesticides contain the insecticides rotenone and permethrin
              (found in clothing and nets that are used to kill mosquitoes).
              Both of these insecticides induce the death of dopaminergic
              neurons. Another way that pesticides can cause neuron death
              involves the fact that they can be inhibitors of the oxidative
              phosphorylation system. Oxidative phosphorylation is a cellular
              process that involves the reduction of oxygen to generate more
              chemical energy in the form of ATP. Dysfunction of this system can
              negatively affect neurogenesis, leading to cell death. As of
              recently, scientists have been trying to gather evidence in favor
              of the hypothesis that early exposure to pesticides during the
              prenatal period can affect the nervous system and increase the
              chance of developing Parkinson’s disease. Different rodent models
              have been tested and they have successfully supported this
              hypothesis. It is important for babies to stay away from areas
              where a lot of pesticides are used like farms.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Manganese</strong> <br />Manganese is known to have the
              ability to accumulate in the basal ganglia and may cause a
              parkinsonian syndrome called manganism. Prolonged occupational
              exposure (>1 mg/m^3) represents a big risk to Parkinson’s disease,
              as Manganese is commonly found in mining and welding sites. Mn
              toxicity is characterized by motor impairments such as hypertonia,
              good bradykinesia, and of course, neurodegeneration that may cause
              Parkinson’s disease. In studies done on humans and animals, Mn
              concentrations in cells have an inverse correlation to dopamine
              levels, providing further proof. A good way to keep Mn
              concentrations in check is intake of good amounts of iron.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>MPTP</strong> <br />The most widely studied chemical that
              can cause parkinsonism is
              1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). When MPTP is
              administered to mice, it causes oxidative stress and mitochondrial
              apoptosis, and this ultimately leads to dopaminergic cell death.
              Oxidative stress involves cells not getting enough oxygen.
              Prolonged exposure to this toxin leads to mitochondrial swelling
              and release of cytochrome C and other intermembrane space, leading
              to activation of caspase-mediated apoptosis. Administration of
              pargyline, a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAO), and/or deprenyl
              can help reduce symptoms of MPTP
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Agent Orange</strong><br />
              Although there is limited evidence to suggest that Agent Orange
              can be a direct cause of Parkinson's disease, exposure to it leads
              to similar symptoms. Studies have shown that exposure to Agent
              Orange leads to symptoms like tremors, loss of balance, and muscle
              rigidity. This means that Agent Orange can possibly be associated
              with causing Parkinson’s disease because of the similar symptoms.
            </p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion:-</h2>
            Parkinson’s disease is one of the most debilitating diseases out
            there. A combination of environment and genetic factors cause this
            crippling disease. There are so many toxins out there in our world
            that the likelihoods of developing Parkinson’s disease for people
            are just going to go up. It is important to inform others of these
            findings so that they may be more careful around these toxins.
