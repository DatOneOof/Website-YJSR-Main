                      <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
                      <p>There has been a long-going discussion between physicists who wonder if singularities, these infinite dense points, could exist outside of black holes.</p>
                      <p>This is known as a naked singularity, which is a black-hole that has been turned inside out and exposed as a naked entity to the universe.</p>
                      <h2 class="section-heading">Theory</h2>
                      <p>According to Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, singularities exist within every black hole at its heart, but we have never experienced one since they are hidden by the event horizon. Theoretically, there is a boundary present around the black hole where light nor any other radiation is able to escape.</p>
                      <p>However, there is a possibility that if a black hole is spinning and it goes fast enough, there would no longer be an event horizon due to the rapidly rotating movement.</p>
                      <p> It is predicted that if the black hole rotates fast enough, another event horizon can be formed inside the first one and eventually be canceled out. Without an event horizon, scientists would be able to see a naked singularity.</p>
                      <p>Theoretical physicists are tangled in a heated debate of whether naked singularities even exist or not. If a singularity could exist outside of a black hole, it would break the laws of physics due to its infinite density.</p>
                      <p> Not only that, but it also defies the Cosmic Censorship, which suggests that all singularities must be hidden from the rest of the universe by an event horizon.</p>
                      <h2 class="section-heading">5-D Black Holes</h2>
                      <p>A group of scientists from the University of Cambridge and Queen Mary University of London have been exploring the concept of naked singularities via computer simulations.</p>
                      <p>They created a thin, ring-shaped black hole which defies the General Theory of Relativity and was simulated in 5 dimensions.</p>
                      <p>Using a supercomputer, they successfully were able to simulate a naked singularity, to fulfill their curiosities of Einstein’s theory in 5 dimensions.</p>
                      <p> One of the researchers who worked on this project explained that the cosmic censorship does not apply for dimensions higher than 4 dimensions, which made it possible for a naked singularity to form in this simulation.</p>
                      <p>During their testing, they discovered that if the black hole was modeled thin enough as a ring, instead of collapsing into a sphere and acting as it would regularly, fat “bulges” that were connected by strings formed.</p>
                      <p>These strings would thin out with time and eventually become “pinched off” to separate into a sequence of scaled-down black holes.</p>
                      <p>At the points where the strings were pinched, naked singularities form.</p>
                      <h2 class="section-heading">Anti-de Sitter Space</h2>
                      <p>So far, no naked singularities have been detected in our universe, but new research indicates that these singularities could form in a distinct fourth-dimensional universe known as anti-de Sitter, or the Tin Can Universe. This discovery was founded by the three scholars Santos, Horowitz and Benson Way.</p>
                      <p>Hence its name, its space-time geometry is shaped like a tin can which allows it to have a boundary.</p>
                      <p>This is unlike ours, which is more or less similar to the geometry of a de Sitter space, where the only boundary is the end of time or infinite future.</p>
                      <p>During a series of computer simulations, the three scholars set out to discover what would happen if an electrical and gravitational field subsided in the anti-de Sitter space.</p>
                      <p> From their observations, they concluded that if they set the energy of the electrical field exceedingly high at the surface/boundary of this universe, it would cause space-time to sharply curve around a point inside the region which would eventually form a naked singularity.</p>
                      <h2 class="section-heading">The Weak Gravity Conjecture</h2>
                      <p>On the other side of the coin, there is quantum gravity to consider. The Weak Gravity Conjecture, suggests that gravity is the weakest force in any given consistent universe.</p>
                      <p>This supposedly supports the Cosmic Censorship conjecture due to the new calculations pertaining to naked singularities.</p>
                      <p>If quantum particles were to exist in the anti-de Sitter universe, the high energy in the electrical field would result in these particles to waver into existence.</p>
                      <p> A factor that could potentially prevent a naked singularity would be fluctuations, because the particles will reach critical mass and cause the region to collapse into a black hole.</p>
                      <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
                      <p>Either way, these subsequent calculations further prove that these two conjectures can co-exist without defying one another.</p>
                      <p> If naked singularities had the possibility of existing in a universe other than the anti-de Sitter universe, they would either defy the third law of black hole thermodynamics, or violate the Cosmic Censorship conjecture.</p>
                      <p>However, one thing is clear; naked singularities have the possibility to exist, just not in the way that we think.</p>
