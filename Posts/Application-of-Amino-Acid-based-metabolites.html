                        <p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative autoimmune inflammatory disease that affects the central nervous system (CNS). Existing diagnostic and treatment methods are invasive and ineffective. This paper aims to ascertain whether there is any biomarker in blood that could potentially determine susceptibility to MS. A differential gene expression was conducted on 12 MS samples and 15 control samples from GEO2R dataset 21942 provided by NCBI. To identify protein interactions, the first 189 genes were selected. Aligned with KEGG, the arginine biosynthesis (AB) pathway was deemed significant. With the abundance of glutamic acid-based compounds in the pathway of AB, downregulated gene GLUD1 was chosen for further research. Glutamate derived from the GLUD1 enzyme was found to be a metabolite in the biomarker approach process. Using metabolomics, measuring the concentration of glutamate in biofluids was proposed as a biomarker for early diagnosis in MS patients. These holistic approaches will help find valuable targets for inhibited genes and pathways correlating to impaired functions, contributing to further understanding of pathological features and the future of personalized medicine.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune inflammatory disease that affects the central nervous system (CNS), with a mortality rate of ~75% [1]. In regard to the term ‘sclerosis’, which means abnormal hardening of the body tissue, MS is broadly categorized as a neurodegenerative demyelinating disease. During this neurodegenerative disease, the immune system of the body destroys myelin sheath/cells (fatty substance) that coat and protect nerve fibers from damage. These sheaths help regulate how fast nerve signals travel from the brain or spinal cord to the affected body part. If the sheath is damaged, the nerve conduction in a specific body area is decreased and deteriorates over time. Although the root cause of this phenomenon is still unknown, there are several symptoms (i.e., numbness in one or more limbs, electric-shock sensations, lack of coordination, vision problems), that vary from person to person and can potentially be used to diagnose this disease [2].</p>
                        <p>The causation for such physical changes is reflected by the symptoms, which are generated at the molecular level. At the cellular level, a genetic approach is one way to correlate these physical changes to diagnosis based on Analyzing differential gene expression in healthy (control) vs disease (experimental) samples. Gene expression, specifically regulation, encompasses the concept of the body-cells genes being either ‘turned on’ or ‘turned off’. Normally, in response to a change in the environment, these patterns are evident during development. By tracking these changes in gene expression between healthy and diseased samples, one can determine how such patterns can lead to certain diseases and correlate them back to biological specific pathways/functions as potential biomarkers.</p>
                        <p>Amino acids play a vital role in various biological reactions, especially in neurotransmission and development of neurodegenerative diseases [3]. In relation to the immune mediated categorization of MS, immune cells require constant intake of amino acids to maintain metabolism [3]. With this broad established biological concept and concerns regarding amino acid levels in relation to diagnosis of MS, this paper will seek to answer the following question and propose a therapeutic target: how does enriched gene expression reflect specific amino acids regulation in significant biological processes affected by Multiple Sclerosis?</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Methods and Analysis</h2>
                        <p>To identify biomarkers for MS, we utilized GSE dataset #21942 from NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) [4] due to unavailability of actual blood/ brain tissue. This dataset of 27 samples (conducted by Anu Kemppinen and her associates) at the University of Cambridge, was published on July 01, 2011 [4]. 12 samples were from MS patients and the rest of 15 were controls (without MS). The design of this experiment consisted of isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from whole blood and the extraction of total RNA. Using microarray expression analysis, this genome-wide expression study was thus done to identify differentially -expressed genes and pathways in MS.</p>
                        <p>Expression of the data was then analyzed and arranged using GEO2R, an interactive web tool that allows to compare two or more groups within a sample (from a GEO series) and further illustrate and identify genes that are differentially expressed. These output values reflected metrics on different components such as logFC, p-value, and t-test figures. Of the vast pool of 54,676 genes in the dataset, it was concluded that p-values greater than 1.01×10-7 to be disregarded due to statistical non-significance. Thus, the first 189 genes were selected for further analysis (p-values ranging from 9.88×10-8 to 1.84×10-13). Since these relatively low p-values correlate to greater statistical differences in gene expression, these genes were then used to analyze gene pathways, networks, and related biological functions. Enriched gene networks/pathways are more significant and valuable for our research objective. In order to find such interactions between the selected 189 genes, STRING Consortium Database of Protein-Protein (P2P) Interaction Networks was used [5] . This database provided a complex, interactive map of all the inputted genes showcasing their connections through different colored nodes, displaying known or predicted P2P interactions by computational means. To take this analytical process a step further, the output of the STRING on gene-gene interactions regarding the desired genes were utilized. One of these output data points was categorized under gene ontology (GO) biological processes. Relevant GO processes were displayed with their term description, matching proteins in the network, false discovery strength (p-value), and term IDs. In order to make more substantiated connections between a good sample pool of enriched proteins, the strongest 5 GO processes were presented by filtering strength and false discovery rate values. Some of the top biological processes were negative regulation of wound healing, spreading of epidermal cells, glutamate biosynthetic process (GBP), and ectopic germ cell programmed cell death. For this particular study, the GBP was chosen due its highest -log value (equivalent to lowest p-value). Taking the lowest p-value increases the probability of the contribution and connecting roles. Once GO was analyzed, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes & Genomes (KEGG) [6] was used to evaluate the pathway (ID 00220) on a genetic level-AB.</p>
                        <p>Amino acids such as glutamine, aspartic, fumaric, and proline all contribute accordingly to arginine metabolism and regulate its role in the urea cycle. Narrowing the scope of potential targets within amino acids, the most common root term present in the mapped pathway is ‘glut’: a collective group of enzymes, phosphates, and metabolites (e.g., L-glutamine, glutamate, N- Acetyl- glutamyl-P). Since all these terms are correlated to glutamic acid, the role of glutamate metabolism was further studied. Derived from L-glutamine, glutamate is the most abundant neurotransmitter released by nerve cells in the brain. The functionality of glutamate involves stimulating nerve cells to send and receive chemical messages. GBP was found to be the second most important biological process after brief research on proteins listed within the top 5 rows with their respective term descriptions. The two protein coding genes involved in this process, found in both MS and control patients, are GLUD1 and GLUD2.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Results and Discussion on Gene of Focus</h2>
                        <p>Mapping the effects of this downregulation (Fig.1), in relation to glutamate metabolism or specifically of glutamine’s function in cells, was necessary to further validate the connection between the gene itself and the urea cycle. This in turn helped develop a potential target and method to identify such dysregulation for/as a part of early diagnosis in MS patients. Glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) is the enzyme involved in the reversible oxidative deamination of glutamate to α-ketoglutarate (AKG) and ammonia [7]. AKG is an amino acid that plays a critical role in many metabolic processes both in animals and plants. Two of its main functions include providing an important source of glutamine, glutamate, and acting as an antioxidant enzyme essential to redox homeostasis. Redox homeostasis refers to the maintenance of keeping the body in a healthy physiological state [8]. The process includes continuous oxidation and reduction reactions to make energy. The role of AKG as an antioxidant enzyme is essential to overcome oxidative stress - the disturbance or imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species and antioxidant defenses - within the redox homeostasis process [8,9]. If this oxidative stress is not regulated properly, there will be an excess of reactive oxygen species leading to cell damage [10]. Moreover, it can also lead to a loss of energy metabolism. It is evident that the downregulation in the GLUD1 enzyme leads to a cut down of glutamate to AKG conversion. This directly lessens the conversion to or production of AKG, contributing to its potential absence in redox homeostasis and reduces its reconversion back to glutamate. When enough glutamate is not reproduced, it can lead to suppression of glutamine to ornithine conversion (first phase of arginine biosynthesis) and indirectly lead to a dysregulated synthesis of arginine from ornithine in relation to the urea cycle. Deficiency in these essential amino acids and enzymes can initiate molecular disruptions, such as cell apoptosis or a decrease in cell growth and proliferation, leading to an increased susceptibility of humans to infectious diseases through repression on the immune system [9,11].</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>As multiple sclerosis is an immune-mediated disease, the established connection between amino acid regulation and the immune system deems to be of significant importance and should be further studied as a potential target for diagnosis. For further study in future research, application of metabolomics may be useful in early diagnosis methods. Obtaining plasma or even urine samples may even be sufficient and effective in terms of non-invasive procedures.</p>
