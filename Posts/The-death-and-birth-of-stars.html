            <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              Have you ever looked at the night sky and just found yourself
              mesmerized by its vastness and the depth of its shining sky
              lanterns? I know I have, and I always wondered how on earth such
              extraordinary actually exists. How is a star born? And for that
              matter, how does it die? In this article, we are going to tackle
              down the formation of stars, from the gathering of interstellar
              clouds, to the hydrostatic equilibrium and formation of protostars
              and finally the nuclear fusion that actually forms the star the
              second part of this article explains the life sequence of stars
              and the aftermath of their death according to their masses. And we
              will sum u by a conclusion at the end
            </p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">Gas clouds / Interstellar clouds</h2>
            <p>
              There are gas atoms of helium and hydrogen scattered through
              space, and due to their mass (Newton's gravitational law) and
              Einstein's relativity, the atoms attract each other and condense
              into a big cloud of gas and dust. Thus, the more it gathers dust
              and particles, the more it adds to its mass and therefore gathers
              more gravitational forces, which pull them evenly towards the
              centre, shaping a spherical object. As the particles bump into
              each other, they create more friction and heat. Then the cloud
              turns into a protostar with not enough gravitational force to
              create a fusion reaction yet, but as it stabilises in the
              hydro-static equilibrium state, it gathers more dust and elements.
              As it gains about 80% of the solar mass and reaches a temperature
              of about 107 Kelvins, it starts fusing the hydrogen in the core by
              a process called the proton-proton fusion chain, and that’s how a
              star is born.
            </p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">Nuclear fusion</h2>
            <p>
              There are billions of trillions of stars in our universe that
              differ in color and size and we might wonder why is that? To
              tackle this we need to understand how the stars shine.
            </p>
            <p>
              Stars are big, like really big, as are their gravitational forces
              that are so huge they attract the hydrogen and helium atoms to the
              core and smash them together, creating bigger elements by nuclear
              fusion. that emits enormous amounts of energy and radiation that
              sends light to planets like our planet Earth. But the sizes of the
              stars differ; the bigger the star, the bigger the nuclear forces
              it creates. And their colour changes according to that. For
              instance, we can notice the electromagnetic spectrum’s visible
              light, how the colour of the star changes according to their size,
              thus the energy they emit is higher (frequency = higher energy).
            </p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">
              Energy consumption in low mass stars
            </h2>
            <p>
              The low mass stars are those that contain a mass lower than 8
              solar masses, the fusion in the core of the star consumes the fuel
              (the hydrogen) with time. Yet it contains the same size,
              temperature and luminosity until most of it is gone. Then, the
              core of the star starts shrinking and it fuses the rest of the
              hydrogen faster and that energy emitted grows and the star gains
              its size and becomes a Red Giant.
            </p>
            <p>
              The star stays in the red giant state for about a billion years
              and during that time the core fuses the helium into carbon and
              oxygen through the triple alpha process due to the high
              temperature, with time the star then increases and decreases its
              size periodically pulsating until it fuses the rest of the
              elements it becomes bluer and hotter. The core contains mostly
              carbon and oxygen with a thin layer of helium and hydrogen, so the
              core shrinks more but the outer layer expands through the amount
              of energy released, and the red giant becomes a planetary nebula
              with a dense hot core in a size close to earth’s called a white
              dwarf. If the dwarf gains more mass from nearby objects then the
              electrons won't be able to push against the gravity anymore and it
              turns to a supernova.
            </p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">
              Energy consumption in High mass stars
            </h2>
            <p>
              The high mass stars are those who have a mass equal or superior to
              8 solar masses (the mass of our sun 1.9891x 10^30 kg) and due to
              the high mass and temperature the hydrogen fusion happens quicker
              and like the low mass stars it fuses the smaller nuclei to bigger
              ones and that creates so much energy to the outer layers that it
              become a red supergiant. Or if the mass of the star is high enough
              (40 solar masses) they become a blue giant then the star will fuse
              the nuclei to heavier elements up to iron at this point the core
              is stable and there aren't much fusion left for the star to fight
              the gravitational forces and it collapses towards its center that
              even the electro-repulsive forces of the electrons can’t resist
              and by that creating such an enormous amount of energy and heat
              expressed and a bang called the supernova, during this explosion
              most of the elements of the universe are emitted.
            </p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">The afterwards of the supernova</h2>
            <p>
              There are two cases after the supernova and they depend on the
              mass of the remnant of the core. if it is between 1.4 and 3 solar
              masses then it becomes a Neutron Star; that happens because the
              atomic forces can no longer fight the gravitational pull that even
              the electrons fuse into the protons in the electron capture and
              the core turns to this big ball of neutrons and neutrinos and soup
              of neutron plasma.
            </p>

            <p>
              Pulsars are neutron stars that orbit around a fixed axis so they
              emit pulses of electromagnetic waves.
            </p>
            <p>
              Magnetars are big neutron stars with enormous magnetic fields that
              range around 10 billion Tesla.
            </p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">The black-hole</h2>
            <p>
              If the remnants of the supernova are higher than 3 solar masses
              then nothing left can resist the gravitational pull and the core
              crash to a single point with no volume and a density that adds up
              to infinity we call it the infinite singularity, creating one of
              the most wonderful phenomena in the universe: a black hole .
              According to einstein’s theory of relativity any system with mass
              curvatures space-time, and the higher the mass is the more
              gravitational pull that system has to its surroundings,so for a
              black hole with an infinite density and mass nothing can escape
              the gravitational field it creates, not even light once arrived at
              the event horizon the glowing part spinning around the black hole
              is called the accretion disk which is whatever gas, dust or
              particles that remain of any celestial object the black hole
              devours and shreds only adding more mass to its singularity Until
              now scientists haven't figured out what's beyond the event horizon
              since nothing can come back from it. In 2019 NASA released the
              first picture of a blackhole detected accidentally by The Event
              Horizon Telescope (EHT).
            </p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              The blackholes open up a whole new field of studies in physics;
              scientists haven't figured out what’s beyond the event horizon or
              further information about the infinite singularity yet. The death
              of stars creates the chance for the birth of new stars, the
              explosion of the supernova and the planetary nebula creates more
              dust and gas that contributes to the birth of new ones.
