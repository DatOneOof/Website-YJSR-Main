                        <p><b>What is a dream?</b></p>
                        <p>On the one hand, the dream is what contributes to the processing and storage of information. This is one of the most integral parts of a person's life, which helps him to be filled with energy and just 'renew'. On the other hand, it increases our efficiency and controls our mood, changeability, and even relationships.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Views of philosophers</h2>
                        <p>There are different philosophical views on the topic of dreams. For them, a dream is something that really exists. It is also an illusion or hallucination. <br><i>"Life and dreams are pages of the same book. To read them in order is to live, to glance through them is to dream."</i> - Arthur Schopenhauer.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">A dream in terms of philosophy</h2>
                        <p>Going back to the ancient world, dreaming was treated as something that contributes to the treatment and is one of the types of medicine. However, this is only one of the people’s opinions. For instance, Plato believed that sleep is God's epistle and one of the theological methods of obtaining knowledge about God. Besides, it indicated a way of knowing human morality. His studies were continued by Aristotle and in the treatise ‘Parva Naturalia’ he said that this is the language of the body and when immersing in sleep, the human consciousness becomes free and gives outbursts of imagination received from the impressions of the day.</p>
                        <p>Dreaming is the excitement of the soul, said Artemidorus from Dadis, who turned his attention to predictions based on dreams. From his point of view, the dreamer receives contact with his soul, thanks to which he can find out about future events. Artmeidor divides all dreams into five types: allegorical (in the form of a riddle that comes true after a while), clear (an exact match and comes true after a short time), personal (when the dreamer dreams of himself), strangers (sees in dreams another person) and related (sees relatives).</p>
                        <p>By and large, the ancient philosophers noticed that a dream personifies your state of mind. This is the time when your soul connects with the body and gives signals to consciousness, that is, imagination. Maybe this is saying about your mental state, feelings, and worries. At some moments, you think out the solution to any exciting situation subconsciously, which is a prediction.</p>
                        <p>The priest of the Russian Orthodox Church, Pavel Alexandrovich Florensky, believed that dreaming is the boundary between wakefulness and sleep though. He describes it as a stage of life in the invisible and allows everyone to experience a ‘second’ life and understand that life is not the only thing that we tend to consider life. The philosopher singles out this state precisely during deep sleep. Florensky admitted a great point that short dream (according to the external dimension) takes a longer period in our life. In a dream, the time system is completely different, where it flies with great speed and a person can perceive it only in the waking state. This effect confirms the rapid forgetfulness of sleep after waking up.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">So what is the importance of dreams?</h2>
                        <p>In the sleep time, you finally allow yourself to be alone with the soul. You become more aware, your brain processes all the information and you can finally relax. The effect is very similar to the effect after meditation when you work with the inner world and dive into yourself. You can survive those very difficult situations for you, or vice versa, and see a pleasing dream after an anxious day. Dreaming is when your body is at rest. In this position, you are at a deep level and are alone with your own ‘Self’.</p>
                        <p><b>The importance of sleep in our mental and physical state.</b></p>
                        <p><i>‘It is a good viewpoint to see the world as a dream. When you have something like a nightmare, you will wake up and tell yourself that it was only a dream. It is said that the world we live in is not a bit different from this.’</i> - Yamamoto Tsunetomo from Hagakure book.</p>
