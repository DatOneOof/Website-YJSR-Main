                        <p>Ever imagined what happens to satellites after they stop working? Do they keep orbiting the Earth or do they retrace their path back to Earth? If they keep floating in space, do they cause harm to other space crafts?<br><br>

Satellites serve a predominant purpose for us on Earth. Telecommunication, Internet, GPS, and Weather forecasts are just a few of the countless functions of these space crafts. The first satellite was launched in 1957 but it was only until the 1990s that we started realizing the dangers of “Space debris”. As defined by NASA, “Space junk, or space debris, is any piece of machinery or debris left by humans in space” This includes failed satellites, rockets used for launching them, and small pieces of destroyed space crafts. Out of the approximately 6,000 satellites in space, only 2666 are functional, the rest are just orbiting Earth along with an estimated 100 million pieces of useless space debris. Much more debris – which is too small to be tracked – exists in the lower orbital of the earth.<br><br>

This space junk poses a hazardous threat to the functional satellites as well as to all future space missions. Even the tiniest of particles can cause massive damage as they orbit the Earth at rapid speeds of 15,700 miles per hour (25,250 km/hr) due to a lack of friction in space. One such disastrous event occurred in 1994, wherein a fleck of paint created a pit in the front window of the Space Shuttle Challenger’s second flight causing chaos in the spacecraft. [1] Another such event happened on January 11, 2007, when Fengyun-1C, a weather satellite launched by China, was destroyed by the military in a test of an anti-satellite system, creating more than 3,000 fragments of space debris. Within two years those fragments had spread out from Fengyun-1C’s original orbit to form a cloud of debris that completely encircled Earth and that would not reenter the atmosphere for decades. On January 22, 2013, the Russian laser-ranging satellite BLITZ (Ball Lens in Space) experienced a sudden change in its orbit and its spin, which caused scientists to abandon the mission. The cause was believed to have been a collision with a piece of Fengyun-1C debris.<br><br>

These collisions can generate more debris in a cascading effect, increasing the collision risk. Further on, the threat will keep accelerating and various accidents will occur contributing to the drastic increase of debris. Donald Kessler, a NASA scientist, imagined what is now known as “Kessler Syndrome” in which he theorized that continuous collisions of man-made objects in space will potentially destroy telecommunications and keep humanity trapped on Earth.<br><br>

This was just a glimpse of the menaces it possesses in space. Though space debris rarely ever enters the Earth and burns up in the atmosphere, it is still possible that larger pieces of debris reach the ground. It has been observed that 200-240 pieces of debris manage to enter our earth and collide with the surface. But due to the vast expanse of water, it rarely harms human habitations.<br><br>

In essence, any expedition that might take man somewhere is going to be a huge problem. All missions to find life anywhere else will be remote. Therefore, before planning for the colonization of other celestial bodies - we should work towards vacuuming the path for such space missions. The problem of space debris is a complex and ongoing challenge that requires international cooperation, innovative technologies, and responsible space practices to ensure the long-term sustainability of space activities. It is not long before satellites become stars for us and space debris becomes a barricade - possibly trapping humans on planet Earth forever.
