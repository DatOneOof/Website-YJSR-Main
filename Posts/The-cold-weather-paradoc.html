                        <h2 class="section-heading">Overview</h2>
                        <p>Examining the mechanisms of immunosuppression in the fall and winter. <br>A description of how the body’s physiology interacts with its environment throughout the festive times of the year.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>A cough, a sneeze, and a rosy nose in the fall and winter are all indications of seasonal sickness. We know autumn for its warm, cozy tones; and winter for being chilly; and rather nostalgic. The end of the year is a period of holidays and great fun, yet we can also recognize that time for an increased chance of contracting allergies and sickness. This phenomenon has a cause, and the body goes through a process to get rid of foreign antibodies that are brought in by the environment during the colder months.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Basics of Immunology</h2>
                        <p>It's not just us humans who have police and security, the individual human body has them as well. The immune system is your body's network of resilient fighters. The immune system’s main function is to protect the body against foreign invaders who have the potential to harm the body or spread infectiously. Over the expansion of time, the immune system has adapted to antigens as quickly as possible. As antibodies—proteins made to kill bacteria—are gradually built up, the body can learn about prior germs that have already entered the body and shut off the foreign substances before they ever cause harm. Hence the phrase, "building immunity."</p>
                        <p>The building blocks of the immune system are made of leukocytes, otherwise known as white blood cells. Leukocytes originate from the bone marrow and continuously circulate within the blood cells and tissues. They constantly monitor the body’s systems and eliminate anything that is deemed harmful or foreign.</p>
                        <p>During the process of detecting and eliminating antigens, symptoms of sickness are found to help in the process of combating it. Researchers have discovered that when the white blood cells decide to fight antigens throughout the body, the body cells can be harmed and produce chemicals that leak into the tissues; which can explain certain symptoms of high temperature due to the inflamed tissues.</p>
                        <p>Although it can be a nuisance, a high temperature is the best-case scenario when fighting off bodily invaders. Bacteria are generally temperature-sensitive and fail to reproduce and spread in warmer temperatures. Thus, that's why we cook meat or eggs before consuming them; their original form is filled with a plethora of bacteria and inconsumable substances.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">The Role of Cold Weather</h2>
                        <p>So why is it that during a specific time of year, you’re more likely to acquire sickness? As stated previously, the body uses its methods of secreting certain chemicals to kill the overarching bacteria, which affects the surrounding tissues and creates tangible symptoms.</p>
                        <p>However, during cold weather—which is most commonly found at the end to the beginning of the year—you are constantly breathing in cold air, which makes its way into your upper airways and throughout your body. Your body's regulated lower temperature sets a threshold for infectious germs to thrive and expand, which makes you ill and causes some of the symptoms you experience.</p>
                        <p>In a 2007 study, researchers found that the transmission speed of an influenza virus was dependent upon the temperature in which it was spreading. The experiment was conducted by inoculating six guinea pigs (grouped in three pairs of two) nasally with a phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), with an influenza virus; and housing them at three separate temperatures (5°C, 20°C, 30°C). The results indicated that transmission thrived more at 5°C, the lowest temperature. These findings further prove the theories surrounding antigens thriving in lower temperatures rather than higher ones.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>Hence, it isn’t the chilly temperature that creates the virus per se, it's the environment giving the germs a more comfortable area to thrive in. That's why it's important to wear the proper clothing according to the weather; moreover, in summer we tend to wear more skin-baring clothing since being overly warm can cause heat exhaustion.</p>
                        <p>Another reason for this phenomenon could be that the blood constricts in response to cold temperatures, this action is called vasoconstriction, the act of the blood vessels narrowing. Since the blood vessels are constricted, it makes it more difficult for the white blood cells to reach the target area of infection.</p>
