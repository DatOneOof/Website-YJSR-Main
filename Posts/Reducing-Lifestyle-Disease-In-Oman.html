                        <p>During the past 35 years Oman has undergone a rapid socioeconomic and epidemiological transition leading to a steep reduction in child and adult mortality and morbidity due to the decline of various communicable diseases, including vaccine-preventable diseases. Good governance and planning, together with leadership and commitment by the government, has been a critical factor in this reduction. However, with increasing prosperity, lifestyle-related noncommunicable diseases have emerged as new health challenges to the country, with cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and obesity in the lead among other chronic conditions. Lifestyle diseases were the leading cause of hospitalisation in Oman in 2018. More people in Oman were admitted to hospital in 2018 for non-communicable diseases (NCDs), which are largely caused by poor lifestyle, than for communicable diseases.</p>
                        
                        <p>Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) have become a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in Oman. The adoption of unhealthy and sedentary lifestyles associated with rising income is trending with a large number of individuals and is contributing to the emergence of substantial health issues. Ultimately, the incidence of NCDs has increased considerably.</p>
                        
                        <p>The World Health Organisation says on NCDs, “Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes, are the leading cause of mortality in the world. This invisible epidemic is an under-appreciated cause of poverty and hinders the economic development of many countries.” “The burden is growing...the number of people, families and communities afflicted is increasing,” added WHO.</p>
                        
                        <p>Although Oman is ranked second from bottom in the GCC region when it comes to deaths from lifestyle-related diseases, medical experts in the region have warned that rankings may soon get worse as stress at work begins to take its toll on people’s health.<a href="https://timesofoman.com/article/102247/Oman/Health/Stress-top-cause-of-lifestyle-diseases-in-the-Sultanate"> (https://timesofoman.com/article/102247/Oman/Health/Stress-top-cause-of-lifestyle-diseases-in-the-Sultanate)</a></p>
                        
                        <p>According to the World Health Organisation, 68 per cent of all disease-related deaths in the Sultanate stem from lifestyle-based ailments, which include cardiovascular problems and diabetes. </p>
                        
                        <p>Cardiovascular diseases, such as bronchitis and emphysema, accounted for 33 per cent of all lifestyle diseases, while diabetes and cancer contributed 10 per cent each.</p>
                        
                        <p>In the GCC region, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain top the list in terms of lifestyle-based deaths (both 78 per cent) while Kuwait follows with 73 percent and Qatar comes next with 69 per cent.</p>
                        
                        <p>A cross-sectional, prospective, observational community-based survey was conducted in the Sultanate of Oman based on the WHO STEPwise approach to Surveillance (STEPS). Multi-stage stratified random sampling selected a total of 9053 households (Omani nationals and non-Omani residents) and one eligible adult selected from each household randomly accounting for 6582 consenting participants. The survey used demographic and behavioural information questionnaires along with physical and biochemical measurements among adults aged 18 years and above. The prevalence of behavioural risk factors such as tobacco use was 9%, alcohol consumption was 2%, insufficient fruit or vegetable intake was 61%, and insufficient physical activity was 39%. The prevalence of biological risk factors such as overweight and obesity was 66%, raised blood pressure was 33%, raised blood glucose was 16%, and raised blood cholesterol was 36%. The prevalence of multiple risk factors was also determined and 95% of the population were found to have more than one risk factor. Three or more risk factors were found among 33% of the population aged 18 years and above and 45% of the population aged 45 years and above.</p>
