                        <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>There has not been a single week this year where a mass shooting has not taken place in the United States of America. As stated by the Gun Violence Archive, there have been more than 250 mass shootings in the United States, averaging around four to five mass shootings a week. Unfortunately, these statistical numbers of mass shootings also account for several school shootings that happened this year. The phenomenon of school shootings is heavily acquired by the United States, as it is the leading country to have the most school shootings in the world, being 288 school shootings from 2009-2018. The United States' G7 partners, an inter-governmental political forum including Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom, had a record of 5 school shootings <i>combined</i> in this same time frame. Not only are the impacts of these school shootings detrimental to school systems, victims, survivors and their loved ones, but it also impacts the mental health of high-school and college-aged students. As mental health is an area in science that has been studied for years, many scientists and doctors have concluded that many mental health issues possessed within a given individual may be caused by genetic factors but also environmental and social factors. Many believe that these factors may interfere with the communication between neurons in the brain, also known as neurotransmission.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Turning It Into a Research</h2>
                        <p>Intrigued and saddened by the correlation between mental health and the recent school shootings in America, I decided to conduct a research experiment. In this behavioral science research project, 20 questions were asked of 32 students from the grades of incoming high school Freshmen to last year's college seniors (ages 14-22) to participate in a survey with a series of questions related to their current mental well being in direct correlation of the recent school shootings. The survey took approximately seven minutes, and it was confidential. Subjects identified themselves by numbers and not names. All of them were between the ages of 14-22, enrolled in high school, college, or an educational place of study, and lived/ currently live in the United States of America. The 20 questions in the survey each listed a statement. Each subject circled a bubble from numbers 1-5, where 1 stated that they strongly disagreed with the statement, and 5 of them strongly agreed. Informed consent was given before the start of the survey.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Hypothesis</h2>
                        <p>If an individual, given they are a student, is aware and exposed to the reality and severity of school shootings in the United States, then that individual's mental health will be negatively affected.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Part I</h2>
                        <p>The first three questions of the survey asked about the participant's feelings about the place of their education, and whether they felt safe or comforted at that given place. 31.3% of participants strongly agreed with the statement, <i>&OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;You feel that your institution does not possess the proper personnel or equipment in case of a school shooting&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;</i>. 43.8% of participants felt neutral about the statement, <i>&OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;You feel 100% safe in your school&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;</i>. When presented with the statement, <i>&OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;The recent school shootings have made you feel less interested in everyday school activities&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;</i>, 34.4% of the subjects disagreed. It was concerning to conclude that most students in the survey felt strongly that their given institution did not possess the proper personnel or equipment if a school shooting were to arise. This may cause a sense of paranoia and fear for an individual, if they believe that their place of education could not protect them in case of a school shooting, resulting in a more anxious school environment. As 43.8% of participants felt neutral about their school being 100% safe, it poses a serious concern to the mental health of students. Feeling safe at school is a vital factor in a student's education, and especially their mental health. How are students expected to concentrate and perform well in school, if they do not know how safe they truly are in that given environment?</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Part II</h2>
                        <p>The next four questions asked about the individual's physical well-being. These questions were important to the survey, as they explored how much the mental health of these participants has affected them physically. Surprisingly, poor mental health can result in poor physical habits and physical being. 27.7% of participants disagreed with the following statement, <i>&OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;The recent school shootings have caused you to be easily distracted.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;</i> Less than half of the participants, 40.6%, strongly disagreed with the statement, <i>&OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;The recent school shootings have made it hard to fall asleep.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;</i> 53.1% of participants strongly disagreed with the statement, <i>&OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;The recent school shootings have made you have a change in appetite, specifically at school,&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;</i> along with 50% of participants strongly disagreeing with the statement, <i>&OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;The recent school shootings have made you feel poorly energized.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;</i> Although almost half of the participants disagreed with the questions concerning poor physical well-being about poor mental health, many participants were still poorly affected. This could mean that many students in the United States struggle with poor physical and mental health because of the recent school shootings, but it was not focused on because students did not express how they felt.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Part III</h2>
                        <p>Nine questions focused on the mental well being of the participants. Some common signs of a poor mental health include but are not limited to: sadness, reduced ability to focus, suicidal thinking, significant tiredness, anxiety, depression, paranoia, extreme mood changed, and withdrawal from activities, families, and friends. 28.1% of subjects strongly disagreed to, <i>&OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;The recent school shootings have made you feel irritable and more emotional than usual.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;</i> 37.5% strongly agreed to <i>&OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;The recent school shootings have made you more paranoid of a mass shooting to occur.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;</i> 31.3% fell neutral to the statement, <i>&OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;The recent school shootings have made you feel anxious and depressed.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;</i> 43.8% strongly disagreed with the statement, <i>&OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;You do not ever fear a school shooting arising.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;</i> Some subjects are negatively affected by the recent school shootings, as anxiety and depression still prevails in their life. Many subjects confirmed their fear of a school shooting arising, which should not even be a fear that exists. 37.5% of subjects responded neutrally to the statement, <i>&OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;our mental health has not been affected by the recent school shootings.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;</i> 37.5% disagreed with the statement, <i>&OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;You do not feel safe in your place of education, in fear of a school shooting.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;</i> 43.8% strongly agreed with the statement, <i>&OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;You often think about what you would do in a situation where you were subject to a mass shooting at your school.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;</i> 31.3% strongly disagreed with the statement, <i>&OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;You often wonder if you will make it home from school everyday.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;</i> 40.6% disagreed with the statement, <i>&OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;You often feel tense, scared, or anxious on your way to school.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;</i> Many participants are inclined to having poor mental health in regards to school settings due to their fear of a school shooting arising. An individual's mental being can impact not only their own lives, but the lives around them. Creating a safe and tolerant space for students in mental distress is essential in understanding and bettering the mental health of students in this country.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Part IV</h2>
                        <p>The last important aspect of one's mental health is the social aspect. When an individual is exposed to the reality of school shootings socially, it can positively or negatively affect their mental health. 31.3% of participants agreed with the statement, <i>&OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;Hearing stories about school shootings upset you, and you rather not talk or engage in conversations about it.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;</i> 25% agreed with the statement, <i>&OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;Your parents warn you about the dangers of school shootings and what to do in those situations.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;</i> 43.8% strongly disagreed with <i>&OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;Reading articles, watching the news, and hearing stories about school shootings make you extremely upset, to the point where you may cry or harm yourself.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;</i> 68.8% strongly agreed with the statement, <i>&OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;School shootings must be talked about to raise awareness and protect human lives and mental health.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;</i> Society plays a large part in one's mental being enough as it is. It has somewhat increased with the number of school shootings that have taken place. Some individuals are warned about school shootings through media, family, and friends. Digesting the reality of it all can be overwhelming for some and model a threat to one's mental well-being.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>As unfortunate as it is, the recent school shootings in America have impacted many students throughout the country regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, and sexual orientation. Mental health is such a crucial factor in the world of science and medicine, as it reveals so much about the human brain and its capabilities. The various mental health crises among high-school and college-aged people continue to rise, and some are directly affiliated with the recent school shootings. The science behind it all is fascinating yet terrifying, as we continue to learn about ourselves in our societies. Our minds are a beautiful and powerful resource that can be used to speak up against these terrible circumstances. For anyone struggling with their mental health, whether it's related to the recent school shootings or not, help is always available to you, and you are not alone.</p>
