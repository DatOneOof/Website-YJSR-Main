                        <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>Birds are truly fascinating creatures. It is always a magnificent sight to witness large flocks of birds making their journey in pursuit of a sufficient habitat and abundant food. These journeys could last from a single week of non-stop flying to months in high altitude, unfamiliar terrain, or even the open sea. The amount of energy needed to be consumed during migration has a direct correlation to the optimal time in which the birds decide to take flight. The time taken is directly proportional to the speed, which is inversely proportional to the weight of the bird. Although it heavily varies from species to species, if unpredictable weather conditions get in the way, stops in the journey may become longer, rates of mortality become higher, and a change of course could occur.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">The Effect of Climate Change</h2>
                        <p>The potential for phenological miscuing (responding inappropriately to climate change, including a lack of response) and for phenological disjunction (in which a bird species becomes out of synchrony with its environment) are beginning to be demonstrated. [1] Birds are very dynamic in population nonetheless, and the world has always gone through changes that landbirds have developed and even adapted through. But that was over the course of thousands of years without the influence of man-kind. El Niño occurrences, which are produced by periodic warming of the oceans off the west coast of the Americas, are prime examples of a common occurrence which has a wide-ranging impact on seabirds. When such occurrences happen, seabirds in the Pacific suffer catastrophic breeding failure or even adult mortality. [2] The El Niño phenomenon is natural, and typically occurs every two to seven years in the pacific equatorial region. [3] But the natural impact on neighboring ecosystems and affected wildlife could be amplified by the high amounts of greenhouse gasses we release every year.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">The Phenology of Birds</h2>
                        <p>Phenology is the study of periodic events in biological life cycles and how seasonal and annual fluctuations and changes in the climate influence these events. Every spring, a precise synchronization takes place between the peak accessibility of important food supplies and the timing of bird migration, breeding, and nesting. This delicate synchronization takes place across wide latitudinal gradients and a variety of ecosystems. This coordination between birds and critical resources ensures that birds effectively survive migration and breed. [4] It is said that phenological shifts are one of the most pervasive ways that climate change has an impact on wildlife.</p>
                        <p>Although there is a general improvement in bird phenology, this advancement is not always occurring at the same rate as needed. As a result of the fact that birds and the species with whom they interact (such as their prey, predators, and competitors) do not respond to warming in the same way, climate change has the potential to throw off these vital connections. Studies have generally shown that species higher in the food chain, such as birds, have advanced their phenology less than species lower in the food chain, such as plants and insects.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">The Joint Relationship of Wildlife Phenology and Climate Change</h2>
                        <p>In response to the variations in temperature, changes in the phenology of wildlife such as birds is becoming more and more common as the earth continues to warm. Shifts in the phenology of autumn migration and wing length among reedbed passerines along the East Asian–Australasian Flyway has been observed in the previous year. [5] In the article, it was discovered that two of the species they studied developed relative to the warmer temperatures in Hong Kong. They found evidence that, over the past 30 years, wing lengths have changed, which may be a direct result of rising temperatures or an indirect result of shifting migratory dates or distances. Despite the study's limited taxonomic and geographic scope, the results are consistent with shifts seen in other parts of the globe.</p>
                        <p>In observations of the changes in the phenology of birds and other wildlife, we can get a circumstantial set of data and contingencies that aid meteorologists, climate activists, and scientists all around the world. This relationship also works the other way around — where conservationists, ecologists, and biologists figure out key attributes and patterns in birds and wildlife that could not have been observed otherwise.</p>
