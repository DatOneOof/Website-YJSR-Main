            <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              Welcome to the captivating world of chess, where kings and queens,
              knights and rooks, bishops, and pawns engage in battle on a
              checkered battlefield. Beyond the intricate pieces and the
              hardwood board lies a fascinating mathematical intricacy that has
              intrigued minds for millennia. Let's delve into the depths of
              chess's mathematical underpinnings.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Chess Rating System</h2>
            <p>
              Chess is a game of strategy and skill. But how do we measure a
              player's ability in this complex game? That's where chess ratings
              come into play. In this article, you will learn about the Elo
              rating system, how it works, and what it means for players. Let's
              begin. The Elo rating system was developed by Arpad Elo, an
              American physics professor and chess master. It assigns a
              numerical value to each player, representing their skill level and
              probability of winning a game. The International Chess Federation
              sets the minimum rating at 100, while the highest rating ever
              achieved is 2882 by Magnus Carlsen.. The rating difference between
              two players may indicate the outcome of a match. When two players
              with equal ratings compete, they should win the same number of
              games. When there is a rating difference, however, the anticipated
              score for the stronger player rises. A player with a rating 100
              points greater than their opponent, for example, is predicted to
              score approximately 64%. To calculate the expected score () of
              Player A against Player B, we use the logistic curve formula:
            </p>
            <img src="/assets/others/Picture 1 - chess.png" alt="" />
            <p class="img-cap">Figure 1</p>
            <p>
              Here, represents Player A's rating, represents Player B's rating,
              and represents the expected score of Player A. After a game, a
              player's rating is adjusted based on the result and the ratings of
              their opponents. The adjustment is calculated using the following
              formula:
            </p>
            <img
              src="/assets/others/Picture 2 - chess.png"
              class="illus-img"
              alt=""
            />
            <p class="img-cap">Figure 2</p>
            <p>
              Here, represents the updated rating of Player A, represents the
              rating before the game, K is the K-factor (which determines the
              magnitude of rating changes), is the actual score of the game (1
              for a win, 0.5 for a draw, and 0 for a loss), and is the expected
              score. The K-factor plays an important role in rating adjustments.
              It determines the impact of each game on a player's rating. Higher
              K-factors result in more significant rating changes, while lower
              K-factors lead to more stable ratings. Players who exceed
              expectations are rewarded, while those who fall short are
              punished. Let's consider an example: a player with a rating of
              1000 and a K-factor of 20. If their expected chance of winning a
              game is 20% ( = 0.2) and they actually win the game ( = 1), their
              new rating would be calculated as follows: 1000 + 20(1 - 0.2) =
              1016. In this case, the player gains 16 points for surpassing
              expectations. Conversely, losing a game that was expected to be
              won can result in a significant loss of points. The magnitude of
              rating changes is influenced by the difference in ratings between
              players. The larger the rating difference, the fewer points are
              gained or lost by the higher-rated player, as the expected outcome
              is more predictable.
            </p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">The Knight’s Tour Problem</h2>
            <p>
              The Knight's Tour is a popular chess puzzle. The challenge is to
              devise a move sequence that allows a knight to visit every square
              on a chessboard exactly once. The knight can move in an L-shaped
              pattern, with two squares in one direction (vertically or
              horizontally) and one square in the opposite way. The problem can
              be represented as a graph, with each square on the chessboard
              representing a vertex, and knight's moves representing edges
              between the vertices. The task is to find a Hamiltonian cycle -a
              cycle that visits every vertex exactly once- in this graph. While
              the task may appear straightforward on an 8x8 chessboard, the
              complexity climbs exponentially as the board size increases; that
              is for sure an exciting brainteaser.
            </p>
            <img
              src="/assets/others/Picture 3 - chess.png"
              class="illus-img"

            />
            <p class="img-cap">

            </p>
            <p>
              Now that we know more about it, let’s move on with Schwenk’s
              Theorem, which is a significant result in graph theory related to
              the Knight's Tour problem. David Schwenk proved that for any m × n
              board with m ≤ n, a closed knight's tour is always possible unless
              one or more of these three conditions are met:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>m and n are both odd</li>
              <li>m = 1, 2, or 4</li>
              <li>m = 3 and n = 4, 6, or 8.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              The theorem establishes both a necessary and sufficient condition
              for the existence of a closed Knight's Tour on a certain sort of
              chessboard. Furthermore, it helps focus efforts on finding
              solutions for those sizes. The theorem has practical applications
              in chess studies and is used as a starting point for researching
              the Knight's Tour problem on different board dimensions.
            </p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">The Shannon Number</h2>
            <p>
              The Shannon number is named after Claude Shannon, an American
              mathematician who calculated a lower limit estimate of chess's
              game-tree complexity in his landmark 1950 paper "Programming a
              Computer for Playing Chess." This lower bound is based on an
              average of possible moves for a pair of moves, with a normal game
              lasting roughly 40 such moves. And the result is a mind-boggling
              potential games. Moreover, Shannon calculated the number of
              possible chess positions to be . It's worth noting that this
              calculation includes several illegal positions, like pawns on the
              first rank or both kings under check. It also ignores legal roles
              obtained through captures and promotions.
            </p>

            />
            <p class="img-cap">Figure 5</p>
            <p>
              As the table above shows, the number of possible games grows
              exponentially with each additional ply. There are now
              69,352,859,712,417 different games that could have been played
              after just 10 plies (or 5 moves for each player). This reveals the
              expanse of the chess game tree and the plethora of options
              available to players at each round. Well, I guess chess is not
              just about 64 squares!
