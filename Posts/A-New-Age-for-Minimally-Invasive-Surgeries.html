              Robot-assisted surgery is a fairly new concept, with the first
              ever record of it being performed during a brain biopsy in the
              1980s, by a robot known as PUMA 560 (Moore, 2018). Since then,
              technology has advanced at an exponential rate, allowing robots to
              be fitted with newer, more specialised features such as endoscopic
              cameras and infrared sensors.
            </p>
            <h2>Why Robotic Surgery?</h2>
            <p>
              The reason as to why some may prefer robotic surgery, over
              traditional surgery, may be due to the fact that robots can carry
              out minimally invasive procedures and move with greater precision.
              This presents itself as a benefit to patients since smaller
              incisions help minimise the risk of complications post-surgery
              (such as infection and blood loss), as well as reducing pain
              during recovery. Moreover, a study conducted by the University of
              Sheffield and UCL (University College London) concluded that
              robot-assisted surgery enabled patients, who were undergoing
              bladder cancer removal, to recover at a faster rate and therefore
              spend 20% less time in hospital as a result (UCL, 2022). This is a
              significant decrease which not only poses as a positive to
              patients, but also to hospitals struggling with high occupancy
              rates and bed shortages, highlighting the benefits of introducing
              surgical systems to healthcare facilities.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the other hand, there are a few drawbacks to surgical robots,
              the primary one being the costs of purchasing and maintaining
              expensive robotic technology. In addition to this, surgeons need
              to be specially trained in order to operate the robots; this
              usually includes undergoing a comprehensive training course, which
              involves simulations, theory modules and supervised operations
              (Hazelden, 2021). If a surgeon does not gain adequate experience
              operating the device, the effectiveness and safety of the
              operation could be put at risk. Furthermore, an article detailing
              the drawbacks of da Vinci Robotic Surgery (DrugDangers, 2022)
              states that “the use of robot-assisted technology may not come
              naturally to all physicians”, which could be due to the fact that
              the use of robots in the medical field is quite new. As a
              consequence, surgeon inexperience has been identified as a leading
              cause of error during robotic surgery.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although these malfunctions can be detrimental, a law firm
              specialising in medical malpractice claims that “errors only occur
              in about 0.1-0.5% of all robotic surgeries”, which is a
              “substantially lower rate” compared to that of mistakes made by
              surgeons during traditional surgery (Caputo, 2020). Therefore,
              surgical robots are usually seen as an efficacious and safer
              alternative to traditional surgery in most cases.
            </p>
            <h2>The Future of Robotic Surgery</h2>
            <p>
              Since the introduction of surgical robots in the 1980s, their
              effectiveness only seeks to increase with the development of AI.
              Currently, robots can be equipped with computer vision, providing
              a high-quality 3D image that is much more effective than the naked
              eye, giving the surgeon an almost ‘superhuman strength’. In the
              future, it is likely that there will be an emphasis on “expanding
              the scope of robotics,” so that it is prevalent in a wider range
              of medical specialities (Mayor and Coppola and Challacombe, 2022).
              In addition to this, efforts are being made towards achieving
              fully automated robots; in 2022, the fully autonomous robot STAR
              was able to complete “one of the most intricate and delicate tasks
              in abdominal surgery”, by suturing two ends of pig intestine at
              Johns Hopkins University (Koetsier, 2022). This breakthrough helps
              support the idea that in the near future, surgical robots may be
              able to carry out low-risk procedures entirely on their own. For
              that reason, with the constant evolution of medical technology, it
              will be interesting to see what a profession in the healthcare
              sector may look like a few decades from now.
