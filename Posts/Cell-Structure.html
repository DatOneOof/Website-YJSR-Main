                        <h2 class="section-heading">INTRODUCTION</h2>
                        <p> Cells are the fundamental unit of life that exists abundantly around us. According to National Geographic, there are an average of 37.2 trillion cells in a person, all with varying purposes and functionality. Processes relating to cells, such as mitosis, meiosis, and DNA synthesis are widely known, but the setting in which these processes take place called the cell structure is much less known. Below, a basic understanding of this setting is provided.</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">PARTS OF THE CELL</h2>
                        <p> There are three primary parts to a cell: the cell membrane (also known as the plasma membrane), the cytoplasm, and the nucleus.</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">THE CELL MEMBRANE</h2>
                        <p> Every cell is enclosed by a cell membrane that separates the external environment from the cell's internal environment. In scientific terms, the external environment is often referred to as extracellular fluids or ECF such as blood, while the internal environment is often referred to as intracellular fluids or ICF such as the cytosol. The cell membrane is made of a double phospholipid layer (also called a bilayer) where one end of the phospholipid is hydrophobic (known as the tail) and the other end is hydrophilic (known as the head). As the ECF and ICF of cells contain fluids, the phospholipid bilayer naturally has its hydrophilic heads facing outward and its hydrophobic tails facing another tail for more efficient interactions with fluids.</p>
                        
                        <p> Beyond just phospholipids in the cell membrane, there are also different kinds of proteins, glycolipids, glycoproteins, and cholesterol. Proteins in the cell membrane take on many roles such as receptor proteins that bond and respond to specific chemical signals and then alter activity in the cell accordingly, and transporter proteins that control movement in and out of cells. Glycolipids play an important role in maintaining cell membrane stability by forming hydrogen bonds with liquid inside and outside the cell. Moreover, they facilitate cell-cell communication by serving as receptors for chemical reactions. Glycoproteins are hydrophilic and thus exist on the surface of the cell membrane. They participate in cell and protein recognition and linkage, adding stability and strength to tissue. Lastly, cholesterol regulates and stabilizes the temperature, viscosity, and fluidity of the cell membrane according to the environment.</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">THE CYTOPLASM</h2>
                        <p> The cytoplasm is what fills the empty space inside of cells. In it, the cytosol is the gel-like fluid where various cell organelles suspend themselves and various chemical reactions take place. Some organelles that exist in the cytoplasm include free ribosomes, the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus, and vesicles. Ribosomes read mRNA sequences that are then translated into amino acid strings and, later, a protein. Thus, ribosomes are on the site where proteins are synthesized. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) includes two different versions: the rough ER and the smooth ER. The rough ER is involved in some protein production, folding, quality control, and delivery as many ribosomes are attached to it. On the other hand, the smooth ER is involved in creating lipids such as phospholipids in the plasma membrane, steroids, and hormones. The Golgi apparatus or Golgi complex receives freshly-synthesized proteins from the ER and further processes, sorts, and packages them before the proteins are sent to their final destinations. In order to get to their destinations, these proteins travel through vesicles, which are small, enclosed membranes that are made from a lipid bilayer. Vesicles are filled with fluid and help transport materials throughout the cytoplasm.</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">THE NUCLEUS</h2>
                        <p> The nucleus is the cytoplasm's largest organelle. Like the cell, it is enclosed by a membrane called the nuclear membrane or nuclear envelope and contains a unique DNA that codes for the creation of proteins. Throughout the organelle, there are nuclear pores which are little holes connecting the inside of the nucleus to the outside. These holes can control what molecules can move in and out such as proteins and RNA. In the central area of the nucleus exist the nucleolus that produce RNA molecules. These RNA molecules read encoded DNA information needed to create proteins.</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">CONCLUSION</h2>
                        <p> Although the cell structure may seem trivial at first glance, the specific layout of organelles and the particular membranes enclosing everything are absolutely necessary for cells to function as they do. Furthermore, beyond just what is described here, cell structure and how it all functions and clicks together are much more complex and intriguing. This article has only covered the fundamentals; further research is required to fully comprehend cell structure.</p>
