                        <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>Due to increased cyber attacks, there has been an increase in demand and requirement for more effective and complex cyber security controls. Artificial Intelligence has been a great source in dealing with these cyber attacks. Cyber security has expanded in response to the need to protect the information and data currently available, and AI has been observed to significantly impact cyber security on a broad scale. Because of this, machine learning has been firmly incorporated into modern cyber security-related technology. This article provides a literature review on the impact of Ai in cyber security as well as telling its limitations in addition to suggesting further research to extend applications of AI and ML in this field.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Types of Cyber Threats</h2>
                        <p>A sort of harmful software known as malware allows any file or program to be used against a computer user. Worms, viruses, Trojans, and spyware are a few examples of different kinds of malware.</p>
                        <p>Another form of malware known as ransom ware entails the attacker encrypting and locking the victim's computer system files before demanding money to unlock and decode them.</p>
                        <p>Attacks that rely on interpersonal contact are known as social engineering. To obtain sensitive information that is generally safeguarded, it tricks users into circumventing security measures.</p>
                        <p>Phishing is a type of social engineering in which phony emails or texts are delivered that appear to be from reliable or well-known sources. The purpose of these communications, which are frequently random attacks, is to collect personal information, including credit cards.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Limitations of AI in Cyber Security</h2>
                        <p>There is always a chance for false positives in the application of AI in cyber security. Ai models are extremely sensitive to changes in conditions which can lead to false results and reduce trust in these systems. Furthermore, AI systems can be hacked which can lead to major security breaches for instance in the case of businesses.</p>
                        <p>Technology in the field of knowledge management for network-centric warfare is challenging. Only automatic information management can produce a speedy assessment of the situation that gives decision-makers and leaders control at every turn. An overview of the centralized and decentralized information models used in the modern command.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps we shouldn't solely rely on Narrow AI for at least a few decades from now given the probable horizon. Some believe that the primary objective of AI, the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI), can be attained by the middle of the 20th century. At Memphis University, the first AGI gathering took place in 2008.</p>
                        <p>Financial organizations and other industries that possess crucial data about our lives are entitled to technology. The technology also holds data about our company that rival companies might utilize to get a competitive edge. Computer professionals and developers must make sure that they have included all the security measures to secure the protection of the data included in the system because of how important information is in the modern world. To ensure data security, computer scientists had to devise a method, thus they had to encrypt their data before delivering it [1]. If the incorrect persons obtain the data, they will still be unable to utilize it thanks to the encryption technique. To decode the data involved, one needs the decryption key.</p>
                        <p>AI employs many data encryption protocols in addition to other techniques. It may come up with a trickier technique to decrypt or fix the problem. The system can ensure that it is challenging enough to ensure that no one can decode the data involved in the transaction by using these various data encryption algorithms. As data security has become more sophisticated and ensured, AI has effectively benefited networking firms and other organizations. Even though they were built to reprogram and develop themselves in the event of any obligation, technology nonetheless has flaws because man invented it.</p>
                        <p>The fact that AI is computer code designed to make sure that it has followed protocols and developed itself in case of anything is one of the most important limits of the technology. This situation could seem acceptable because they can grow on their own if necessary. But because the system is fully designed, anyone may take control of them, manipulate them, and use them as a weapon. Only a few lines of code need to be changed, and after that, the lengthy work hours might be utilized as a weapon by the program itself. Therefore, AI technology can be used as a weapon to harm what it was designed to safeguard if the necessary skills and knowledge are acquired.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Effects of AI on Cyber Security</h2>
                        <p>AI results in both positive as well as negative effects. Area of technology has advanced massively and multiple industries have enhanced due to cyber security like Perol [2]. With the advent of Tech, malicious attacks have become more advanced causing more disruption since attackers have found more and more limits in cyber security systems. Due to ML systems, new algorithms are in place thus attackers can’t use old techniques to exploit systems. Adding AI and ML systems also showcases that mistakes are avoided. AI has been used in numerous ways for their part in cyber [3]</p>
                        <p>The future has been validated to boost AI on a wide scale due to which Ai will be further enhanced to incorporate it into the defense systems of companies. The majority of organizations have felt improvements using AI as well as reducing crimes like cyber malicious attacks. AI technology has greater detection capabilities than a human[4]. Moreover, AI has excellent security protection from hackers and cyber crimes. Real-time traffic monitoring enables AI technology to find activity without correct measurements and focus on actions. In addition, the system has to conform to corporate the matter of ideas dealing with complications early. ML models have enhanced data security measures as this information has to be validated for companies.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>Artificial intelligence is a great asset in countering and mitigating cyber threats but there are still potential issues such as false positives and hacking which reduce its validity. Nonetheless, with the advent of technology, AI systems will eventually be the future of cyber security defending from hackers in addition to malicious threats. The rise of new technological learning in the learning of computers would substantially enhance cyber abilities. With the help of AI, a safer digital environment can be created.</p>
