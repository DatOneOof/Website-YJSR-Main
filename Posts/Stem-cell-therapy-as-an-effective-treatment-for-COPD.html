                        <h2 class="section-heading">Abstract</h2>
                        <p>This article is a literature review paper on the effectiveness of stem cell therapy on COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) to date. Since stem cell therapy is breaking barriers in many other aspects of medicine and science, it is a possibility to see stem cell therapy in use for patients with COPD. According to the research currently available, stem cell therapy has still a very long way to go in order to be a successful and effective source of treatment for patients with COPD. In this paper, relevant research on this topic has been discussed and reviewed to have an overview of the impact stem cell therapy has and might have in the future on COPD patients. Pre-clinical studies have mainly used animal models, different stem cell sources, techniques, and doses to distinguish the effect it has on the animals. Other studies include the methods of infusion and administration of stem cells into COPD patients. Most of the studies on stem cell therapy and COPD have only reached preclinical trials, which is one of the main reasons stem cell therapy is not yet approved by the FDA. The risks and long-term effects of the therapy are yet unknown.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Stem Cell Therapy As An Effective Treatment For Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</h2>
                        <p>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (referred to as COPD hereafter) is an inflammatory lung disease that causes breathing problems mainly among middle-aged and older adults. COPD mainly occurs when the lungs are inflamed and damaged causing a limitation to the airflow to and from the lungs. COPD is more prevalent in cigarette smokers and people who have had long-term exposure to harmful fumes and irritable gas particles. COPD patients are prone to other diseases such as heart disease and lung cancer. 1% of the population with COPD have the disease because of a genetic disorder that causes a low level of alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAt) protein. Emphysema and chronic bronchitis are the main lung conditions that COPD patients are subjected to. Emphysema is when the alveoli in the lungs are damaged making it difficult for gas exchange to occur in the air sacs and causing breathing problems. Chronic bronchitis on the other hand is long-term inflammation of the lining of the airways, which is the pathway for air to travel to and from the alveoli of the lungs. Some of the symptoms include breathlessness, persistent phlegm cough, wheezing, and frequent chest infections. Symptoms usually get worse day by day, since it’s a progressive degenerative disease. This can make it very difficult for the patient to perform day-to-day activities. Times, when the symptoms get worse, are known as exacerbations or flare-ups which occur a few times a year. Although COPD has no cure, it is treatable, allowing the progression of the disease to slow down. The treatments for COPD, to date, involve mainly controlling and suppressing the symptoms. Some of the treatments include quitting smoking, medications such as short-acting and long-acting bronchodilators to relax the muscles around the airway, inhaled steroids to reduce airway inflammation, oral steroids, lung therapies such as oxygen therapy and pulmonary rehabilitation program, and surgery such as bullectomy, lung volume reduction surgery, and lung transplant.</p> 
                        <p>Stem cell therapy is fairly new and very limited research is available when it comes to understanding its efficacy when used to treat COPD. Although the small number of patients who underwent stem cell therapy over the years showed a somewhat promising result, more large-scale research and clinical trials are necessary to understand the safety and efficacy of stem cell therapy in COPD patients. It is a fairly expensive procedure which may be one of the reasons for the limited amount of national and international clinical research available. The FDA does not approve stem cell therapy for any lung conditions, including COPD. The type of stem cells used in the therapy may also be a cause of the success or failure of the therapy. Exogenous mesenchymal stem cells might not be as effective as embryonic stem cells. More research is necessary on the longevity and durability of different types of stem cells in different environments for advanced clinical trials to take place in patients.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Studies and Results</h2>
                        <p></p>
                        <p>Bonet first referred to COPD as having "voluminous lungs" in 1679. About a century later, in 1769, Morgagni confirmed it. They discussed instances where the lungs become "turgid," especially after breathing air. The spirometer was created by John Hutchinson in 1846. The diagnosis of COPD depended on this. The spirometer is still used today to diagnose COPD and conduct routine evaluations of treatment response. The sole parameter Hutchinson measured was vital capacity. Tiffeneau and Pinelli introduced the idea of timed vital capacity as an airflow measurement in 1947.</p>
                        <p>Stem cell therapies are currently being used to treat a wide range of illnesses. Many recent advances in stem cell research have revealed fresh information about the potential of stem cells to treat a number of lung disorders. Numerous preclinical research, mostly focusing on BM-MSCs <i>(bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells)</i>, AD-MSCs <i>(adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells)</i>, and UC-MSCs <i>(umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells)</i>, have recently shown that stem cells have a therapeutic effect in animal models of COPD. Animals used in experiments are treated using a variety of stem cell sources, techniques, doses, and timings. Using the following, stem cell therapy may have the following effects:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Firstly, stem cell therapy can decrease the mean linear interception, lower lung epithelial cell death, and enhance the structural integrity of the diseased lung tissue.</li>
                            <li>Secondly, lung tissue can heal itself with the use of stem cell therapy, which can encourage the growth of different lung cells</li>
                            <li>Thirdly, stem cell therapy can somewhat enhance pulmonary function.</li>
                            <li>Lastly, stem cell therapy can lessen the body's inflammatory reactions and encourage the release of a number of anti-inflammatory mediators.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In 2001, research published by Diane Krause and her colleagues at Yale University studied the idea of administering a stem cell. The publication presented that "systemically hematopoietic stem cells could engraft in various tissues, including the lung, and acquire tissue-specific phenotype and possibly even function" (atsjournals.org) This means that hematopoietic, or immature, cells could attach themselves onto lung tissues and may restore lung function. Endogenous lung airway progenitor cells, which are cells that originate from the lung airway, may have more powerful engraftment properties and contribute to structural repair. This is a progressive and valuable component that provides details regarding being able to "manipulate these cells by their exogenous administration" (atsjournals.com).</p>
                        <p>An uncontrolled phase I clinical trial using cell therapy on COPD patients was conducted in Brazil from May 2009 to October 2009. This study's goal was to assess the safety of an infusion method using bone marrow-derived monocytes (BM-MCs) in patients with severe COPD (GOLD stage IV - very severe, might experience lung or heart failure). Each patient got a total of 1 × 10<sup>8</sup> cells with a single intravenous infusion unlike other studies using BM-MSCs. Researchers claimed that the treatment was safe, as there were no adverse reactions following multiple checkups throughout the year, and their pulmonary functions and clinical conditions improved slightly. Since this trial only consisted of 4 patients, the results did not support firm conclusions.</p>
                        <p>Adipose tissue-derived stem cells contain a much higher percentage of mesenchymal stem cells. They can maintain differentiation potential for a longer time, have a stronger proliferation potential, and can modulate the immune system more effectively. A phase I, open-label, a non-randomized trial conducted by Comella et al. included 12 COPD patients whose SVF <sup>(stromal vascular fraction - contains all cellular elements of fat, excluding adipocytes)</sup> was extracted from the adipose tissue, after which (1.5–3) × 10<sup>8</sup> cells were administered back to the patients intravenously. The main objectives of this investigation were to assess the viability and security of SVF infusion in COPD patients. Although no negative events were noted during the infusion or the 12 months follow-up, the clinical trial lacked objective clinical evidence like pulmonary function testing (which had a necessary impact on it) and relied on subjective patient feedback including their views regarding the surgery and desire to participate in future stem cell therapy. 3 patients stated that there was no effect, 4 stated to have felt better than usual within a day, and 5 people noticed improvements over time, with the greatest improvement occurring about a month after the infusion. Patients had favorable attitudes toward the study</p>
                        <p>Umbilical cord-derived stem cells are a preferable option when an allogeneic stem cell transplant is required since they have a faster rate of proliferation and a stronger capacity for cell differentiation. The first study to use mesenchymal stem cells derived from umbilical cord tissue to treat COPD patients was conducted by Le Thi Bich et al. who completed a pilot clinical trial of treating COPD with UC-MSCs. 20 COPD patients in stages C or D received, intravenously, 1.5 106 expanded allogeneic UC-MSCs/kg taken from donors during childbirth. They were all monitored for six months following the initial infusion and none of the patients experienced any adverse effects throughout the trial. However, there were no statistically significant variations between the pulmonary function before and after the treatment of UC-MSCs. </p>
                        <p>Exogenous mesenchymal stem cell research in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD did not result in any noticeable improvements in respiratory function. However, a study by the Lung Institute titled Autologous Stem Cell Therapy and its Effects on COPD found that over 82 percent of patients who underwent stem cell therapy experienced measurable improvements in their quality of life. To clarify the safety and efficacy of stem cell therapy for most patients, additional large-scale research and clinical trials must be conducted. </p>
                        <p>It is yet unknown how effectively stem cell treatment works for COPD. Currently, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved the use of stem cell therapy for lung conditions, including COPD. The American Lung Association says this is due to high treatment costs and potentially harmful side effects. Although stem cell therapy can be obtained from unlicensed clinics, the cost of the procedure is often expensive and there is no insurance coverage. Many of these individuals reported better walking and lung function after the transfusion. Although stem cell therapy has not been proven to be effective in treating COPD, patients find it to be an appealing choice because of its capacity to restore damaged tissue and low level of invasiveness. </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Limitations</h2>
                        <p>While stem cell therapy has its promising potential for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, there is a potential risk of the stem cells not being able to successfully migrate to the damaged area leading to hemorrhage and therapy rejection. Furthermore, they may not be as efficient as embryonic stem cells in terms of their longevity and durability. Adult stem cells have been difficult to grow for prolonged periods in culture. Extensive research is needed through numerous studies on animals to determine the cells’ ideal environment for survival and longevity. It is important to note the severity of side effects may differ. These steps and precautions are crucial to address before moving on to advanced clinical applications in patients with COPD. Also, this allows researchers to determine whether the overall probability of benefit is greater than the risks involved. One of the big problems that are faced nowadays is the fact that there’s an increase in medical tourism and the promotion of cell-based procedures, which are yet not proven to be beneficial to patients with COPD, by businesses in the US and worldwide. This indeed can be harmful to patients in the future as the consequences are not yet known.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Discussion</h2>
                        <p>Stem cell therapy as a treatment for COPD still has a lot more room for research. There are a few studies such as “Autologous Stem Cell Therapy and its Effects on COPD” and the uncontrolled phase 1 clinical trial in Brazil that show a positive impact. Although the two have an overall positive impact, the clinical trial in Brazil isn’t substantive evidence because of its lack of participants. There isn’t enough research on large-scale and clinical trials so researchers are not sure about its safety therefore are unable to use it on most COPD patients. Not necessarily, because they believe it isn’t safe but because more time is needed to see any side effects or consequences of such medical treatments. Also, stem cell therapy is quite expensive and isn’t covered by insurance so it’s not the best option for many patients. </p>
                        <p>Other studies such as the one published by Diane Krause and her colleagues at Yale University suggest a progressive outlook toward hematopoietic stem cells being able to contribute to structural repair of the lung tissues through their exogenous administration. Some preclinical studies on animals with COPD have shown that stem cell therapy can reduce the apoptosis of the epithelial cells in the lungs and facilitate the self-repair of the lung tissue. Stem cell therapy is very new to the treatment world and the FDA (Food and drug administration) warns against it until they are sure of its effectiveness and safety. </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>Considering it’s fairly new and there is limited research on it, stem cell therapy as a treatment for COPD displays a big future ahead, with results already indicating effectiveness. Although stem cell therapy requires more large-scale research and clinical trials to be able to assess its efficacy rate, there have been numerous cases concluding that it is a treatment for COPD. This procedure brings promising results which include the potential to restore lung function and improve the quality of life in patients with COPD. Unlicensed clinics that have performed this procedure have patients that report better walking and overall functionality of the lungs. This paper covers the history, research, and trials behind Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and stem cell therapy as a treatment. Being so new to the treatment world, stem cell therapy has a lot more trials and research to undergo. While stem cell treatment has not shown the ability to become a cure, its potential ability to repair damaged tissue and reverse the effects of diseases involving inflammatory or degenerative parts, like COPD, makes it a possible and true alternative for patients in the future. </p>
