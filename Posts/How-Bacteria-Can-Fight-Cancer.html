                        <p>Bacteria have a dual role in cancer: they can cause it or help cure it. This mini review examines how bacteria can influence cancer development and treatment, and how they can be used as therapeutic agents. The history of bacterial cancer therapy is traced from Coley's toxins to modern intracellular delivery systems that use non-pathogenic Salmonella to transport vaccine antigens into tumor cells. The advantages of bacteria in cancer therapy are discussed, such as their tumor specificity, tissue penetration, and ability to carry various anti-cancer molecules. The review also covers how bacteria can affect the immune system, both positively and negatively, and how the gut microbiome can modulate the response to immunotherapy. Examples of bacterial strains used in cancer therapy are presented, including engineered Salmonella typhimurium, Clostridium novyi, and Listeria monocytogenes. The challenges and opportunities for bacterial cancer therapy are outlined, such as safety, efficacy, regulation, optimization, and combination with other treatments. The review concludes that bacteria are promising tools for cancer therapy, and that further research is needed to overcome the remaining hurdles and harness their full potential.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>Cancer is one of the most devastating diseases that afflict humanity. It is a complex and diverse group of disorders that involve the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells in the body. Cancer can affect any organ or tissue, and it can cause various symptoms and complications, depending on the type and stage of the disease. According to the World Health Organization, cancer is the second leading cause of death globally, accounting for an estimated 10 million deaths in 2020 [1]. Despite the advances in medical science and technology, cancer remains a formidable challenge for both patients and doctors. The conventional treatments for cancer, such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, have significant limitations and side effects. They often fail to eradicate all the cancer cells, leading to recurrence or metastasis. They also damage healthy cells and tissues, causing pain, nausea, hair loss, infections, and other problems[2].</p>

                        <p>Therefore, there is an urgent need for developing new and innovative strategies for combating cancer. One of the most promising and intriguing avenues of research is the use of bacteria as allies in the fight against cancer. This may sound counterintuitive, as bacteria are usually associated with infections and diseases. However, some bacteria have unique properties that make them ideal candidates for delivering anti-cancer agents to tumors [2,3,4].</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Why Antibiotics Are Not Enough to Cure Cancer</h2>
                        <p>The history of medical science is marked by pivotal moments when groundbreaking discoveries have reshaped the landscape of healthcare. One such moment was the serendipitous discovery of penicillin by Sir Alexander Fleming in 1928 [5]. Penicillin, the world's first antibiotic, revolutionized the treatment of bacterial infections and saved millions of lives in the 20th century[6]. This discovery not only transformed medicine but also inspired innovative approaches to combat diseases. Penicillin, a mold-derived antibiotic, was a game-changer in the fight against infectious diseases [6]. Before its discovery, bacterial infections were a significant threat, with limited treatment options. Penicillin, with its ability to kill harmful bacteria while sparing human cells, was hailed as a miracle drug. Its impact was so profound that it marked the beginning of the antibiotic era, transforming the outlook on previously life-threatening diseases such as pneumonia and sepsis [6]. Inspired by this breakthrough, researchers explored other natural sources of antibiotics, leading to the isolation and synthesis of many other classes of antimicrobial agents, such as streptomycin, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol. These antibiotics expanded the spectrum of activity against different types of bacteria and improved the treatment outcomes for various infections. However, penicillin and subsequent antibiotics faced a unique set of challenges when applied to cancer treatment. Antibiotics are designed to target bacteria, and their effectiveness in cancer therapy was limited by several factors. Firstly, antibiotics had issues with specificity, as they could not selectively target cancer cells while sparing healthy ones [7]. Secondly, there were concerns about antibiotic resistance, rendering them less effective against certain bacterial strains [8]. Thirdly, antibiotics had difficulty in penetrating solid tumors and reaching adequate concentrations at the site of action [9]. Therefore, while antibiotics were life-saving for infectious diseases, they were not a panacea for cancer. The limitations of antibiotics in cancer treatment led to a paradigm shift in the approach to combating cancer. Researchers began to explore the idea of using bacteria as allies in the fight against cancer. The concept was rooted in the recognition that bacteria had unique properties that could be harnessed for therapeutic purposes, particularly in targeting and destroying cancer cells.</p>

                                            <h2 class="section-heading">Bacteria and the immune system</h2>
                        <p>The immune system is our body's defense mechanism against foreign invaders, such as viruses, bacteria, and cancer cells. It consists of various types of cells and molecules that work together to recognize and eliminate threats. However, sometimes the immune system fails to detect or destroy cancer cells, or becomes suppressed by the tumor itself or by treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation [10]. One way that bacteria can help us fight cancer is by modulating the immune system, either directly or indirectly [11]. For example, some bacteria can stimulate inflammation, which is a response of the immune system to injury or infection. Inflammation can attract immune cells to the tumor site and activate them to kill cancer cells. However, inflammation can also have negative effects, such as causing tissue damage or promoting tumor growth [12,13]. Therefore, the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory bacteria is crucial for the outcome of cancer. One example of a pro-inflammatory bacterium that can help fight cancer is Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), which is a weakened form of the bacterium that causes tuberculosis[14]. BCG has been used as a vaccine against tuberculosis for decades, but it also has anti-cancer effects. BCG can be injected into the bladder of patients with bladder cancer, where it causes inflammation and stimulates the immune system to attack the tumor cells [14]. BCG is one of the most effective treatments for non-invasive bladder cancer, and it can prevent recurrence and progression of the disease. Another way that bacteria can affect the immune system is by influencing the gut microbiome, which is the community of microorganisms that live in our digestive tract [15]. The gut microbiome has a complex relationship with the immune system, as it helps to maintain its balance and function. The gut microbiome can also affect the response to cancer treatments that target the immune system, such as immunotherapy.</p>

                        <p>Immunotherapy is a type of treatment that aims to boost the immune system's ability to fight cancer. One class of immunotherapy drugs are called checkpoint inhibitors, which block molecules that prevent the immune system from attacking cancer cells [16]. However, not all patients respond well to these drugs, and some experience severe side effects. Researchers have found that the composition and diversity of the gut microbiome can influence the effectiveness and safety of checkpoint inhibitors [17]. For example, some studies have shown that patients with more diverse and beneficial gut bacteria have better outcomes than those with less diverse or harmful gut bacteria [18,19]. Moreover, some studies have shown that transferring fecal matter from responders to non-responders can improve their response to checkpoint inhibitors [20,21]. One example of a beneficial bacterium that can enhance immunotherapy is Akkermansia muciniphila, which is a common inhabitant of the human gut. A. muciniphila can degrade mucus, which is a protective layer that covers the intestinal lining. By doing so, A. muciniphila can increase the permeability of the intestinal barrier, allowing more immune cells and molecules to enter the bloodstream and reach the tumor site [22]. A. muciniphila can also produce metabolites that modulate the immune system and inhibit tumor growth [23]. Studies have shown that patients with higher levels of A. muciniphila in their gut have better responses to checkpoint inhibitors than those with lower levels [23]. Therefore, manipulating the gut microbiome with probiotics, prebiotics, antibiotics, or fecal transplants could be a promising strategy to enhance immunotherapy for cancer patients.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">The History of Bacteria in Cancer Therapy</h2>
                        <p>The idea of using bacteria as weapons against cancer is not new. In fact, it dates back to the late 19th century, when an American surgeon named William Coley observed that some cancer patients who developed bacterial infections after surgery showed remarkable improvement or even complete remission of their tumors [24]. Inspired by this observation, Coley developed a mixture of inactivated bacteria, known as Coley's toxins, and injected them into cancer patients. His rationale was that the bacterial toxins would stimulate the immune system to attack the tumors [24]. Coley's toxins were one of the first forms of immunotherapy for cancer, a treatment that aims to boost the body's natural defenses against cancer cells [25]. However, Coley's toxins had several drawbacks. They were not very effective for all types of cancers, they had variable results depending on the dose and frequency of administration, and they caused severe fever and inflammation in some patients [26]. Moreover, with the advent of antibiotics in the 20th century, Coley's toxins fell out of favor. Antibiotics revolutionized the treatment of infectious diseases, saving millions of lives from deadly bacteria [26]. However, they also posed a major challenge for using bacteria in cancer therapy. Antibiotics are designed to kill bacteria indiscriminately, regardless of whether they are harmful or beneficial [26]. Therefore, they would also destroy any bacteria that were intended to deliver anti-cancer agents to tumors.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">The Advantages of Bacteria in Cancer Therapy</h2>
                        <p>Despite the obstacles posed by antibiotics, researchers did not give up on the idea of using bacteria as allies in the fight against cancer [27]. They realized that bacteria had several advantages over conventional treatments for cancer [27]. Bacteria are naturally attracted to tumors. This is because tumors create a low-oxygen environment (called hypoxia) that is favorable for some bacteria to grow and multiply [28]. This means that bacteria can selectively target tumors without affecting normal tissues [28]. Bacteria can penetrate deep into tumors. This is because tumors have a disorganized blood vessel network (called angiogenesis) that makes it difficult for drugs and other molecules to reach all the tumor cells [29]. However, bacteria can move through these blood vessels and invade the tumor tissue [30]. Bacteria can carry various anti-cancer agents to tumors. These agents can include genes, proteins, drugs, nanoparticles, or radioactive isotopes that can kill or inhibit tumor cells [31]. Bacteria can be genetically engineered or loaded with these agents using various techniques [31]. Bacteria can modulate the immune system to fight cancer cells. Some bacteria can activate immune cells (such as macrophages and T cells) that can recognize and destroy tumor cells [32]. Other bacteria can suppress immune cells (such as regulatory T cells) that can protect tumor cells from immune attack [32].</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">The Examples of Bacteria in Cancer Therapy</h2>
                        <p>In recent years, researchers have made significant progress in developing and testing various types of bacteria for cancer therapy. Some examples are:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><i>Salmonella typhimurium:</i> This is a type of bacterium that causes food poisoning in humans. However, it can also be modified to target and kill tumor cells [33]. For instance, researchers have engineered a strain of Salmonella typhimurium that can produce a protein called cytosine deaminase (CD) inside tumors [34]. CD can convert a harmless drug called 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) into a toxic drug called 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) that can kill tumor cells [34]. This way, the bacteria can act as a "Trojan horse" that delivers a lethal payload to tumors.</li>
                                <li><i>Clostridium novyi:</i> This is a type of bacterium that can grow only in the absence of oxygen. Therefore, it can thrive in hypoxic tumors, where most conventional treatments fail [35]. Researchers have created a strain of Clostridium novyi that lacks a toxin gene, making it less harmful to humans [23]. They have also loaded the bacteria with nanoparticles that contain a chemotherapy drug called doxorubicin [36]. The bacteria can release the nanoparticles inside tumors, where they can release the drug and kill tumor cells [36].</li>
                            <li><i>Listeria monocytogenes:</i> This is a type of bacterium that can cause serious infections in humans, especially in pregnant women and immunocompromised individuals. However, it can also be used to stimulate the immune system against cancer cells. Researchers have engineered a strain of Listeria monocytogenes that can express a protein called mesothelin on its surface [37]. Mesothelin is a protein that is overexpressed by many types of cancer cells, such as ovarian, pancreatic, and lung cancer cells [38]. The bacteria can bind to these cancer cells and trigger an immune response against them [37].</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Bacteria and anti-cancer substances</h2>
                        <p>Not only can bacteria influence our immune system, but they can also produce substances that have anti-cancer properties. These substances can be of different types and have different effects on tumor cells. Some bacteria can make toxins that damage the DNA or proteins of cancer cells, causing them to die or stop growing [39]. These toxins can be delivered by the bacteria themselves or by viruses that are engineered to infect only tumor cells [39]. However, this strategy has some drawbacks, as the toxins can also harm healthy cells and cause side effects. Some bacteria can make enzymes that break down the extracellular matrix, which is a network of proteins and sugars that surrounds and supports cells. The extracellular matrix plays an important role in cancer development and progression, as it provides structural support, regulates cell behavior, and facilitates invasion and metastasis [40]. By breaking down the extracellular matrix components, such as collagen or hyaluronic acid, the bacteria can reduce the stiffness of the tumor, increase the penetration of drugs, and inhibit the growth of the tumor [40]. Some bacteria can make metabolites that interfere with the metabolism or signaling pathways of cancer cells. Metabolism is the process of converting nutrients into energy and building blocks for cells. Signaling pathways are networks of molecules that transmit information within and between cells [41]. Both metabolism and signaling pathways are often altered in cancer cells to support their growth and survival. By interfering with these processes, the bacteria can induce various effects on tumor cells, such as modulating gene expression, inhibiting inflammation, inducing cell death, or activating immune cells [41]. For example, some bacteria can make short-chain fatty acids, such as butyrate or propionate, or indole derivatives, such as indole-3-carbinol or indole-3-acetic acid [42]. Some bacteria can make molecules that mimic or block the action of natural hormones or growth factors. Hormones and growth factors are substances that regulate various biological processes, such as growth, development, reproduction, and metabolism [43]. Some cancers are driven by the overproduction or over activation of these substances, such as estrogen in breast cancer or epidermal growth factor in lung cancer. By making molecules that act like or against these substances, such as phytoestrogens or EGF inhibitors, the bacteria can compete with or block the receptors for these substances on cancer cells, thereby reducing their stimulation or signaling [44]. Therefore, exploiting the anti-cancer potential of bacterial substances could be a valuable approach to develop novel drugs or enhance existing therapies for cancer patients.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">The Bacterial-Based Intracellular Delivering (ID) System</h2>
                        <p>Fast forward to the present day, and we find ourselves at the cutting edge of cancer therapy. The very recent development of the bacterial-based intracellular delivering (ID) system by Forbes et al. represents a culmination of years of research and innovation [45]. This system utilizes non-toxic Salmonella to deliver a vaccine antigen directly into solid-tumor cancer cells, effectively turning these bacteria into precision-guided delivery vehicles [45]. The ID system works by exploiting the natural ability of Salmonella to invade mammalian cells and survive within them [45]. By genetically modifying Salmonella to express a vaccine antigen that stimulates an anti-tumor immune response, researchers were able to create a self-replicating and self-delivering therapeutic agent that can selectively target and destroy cancer cells.</p>

                        <p>The application of bacteria as a delivery system for cancer therapy is not just a scientific feat; it is also a testament to the inspiration that the discovery of penicillin has provided. The idea of using bacteria to deliver cancer immunotherapy is rooted in the notion of repurposing an organism that was initially seen as a foe, bacteria, into an ally in the battle against cancer. This innovative approach aligns with the vision of overcoming the limitations of antibiotics in cancer therapy. The ID system takes a page from penicillin's legacy by harnessing the capabilities of bacteria to target and attack cancer cells. The result is a novel and promising technique that holds the potential to treat difficult-to-treat cancers, including liver, metastatic breast, and pancreatic tumors, as highlighted in the research conducted by Forbes et al [45]. While the ID system's initial results are promising, further research and rigorous testing are needed before it can be applied to human patients [45]. Some of the challenges that need to be addressed include optimizing the safety and efficacy of the system, ensuring the stability and specificity of the bacterial delivery, and overcoming the possible immune evasion and resistance mechanisms of the cancer cells. Nevertheless, the ID system represents a remarkable example of how the discovery of penicillin has inspired new avenues of research and innovation in cancer therapy. By combining the power of bacteria and immunotherapy, the ID system offers a novel and potentially effective way of fighting cancer from within.</p>


                         <h2 class="section-heading">The Future of Bacteria in Cancer Therapy</h2>
                        <p>Bacteria are emerging as powerful allies in the fight against cancer, offering advantages over conventional treatments such as specificity, penetration, delivery, and modulation, as well as the potential to overcome challenges such as resistance, recurrence, and metastasis [39]. However, bacteria also have limitations and risks, facing similar hurdles as conventional treatments in terms of safety, efficacy, and regulation, as well as unique challenges such as immune evasion, bacterial clearance, and ethical issues [39]. Therefore, more research and development are needed to optimize and validate the use of bacteria in cancer therapy, requiring multidisciplinary collaboration among scientists, engineers, clinicians, regulators, and patients. One of the main challenges is ensuring the safety of bacteria in cancer therapy, as they are living organisms that can evolve and adapt to different environments, posing a risk of infection or toxicity to the host or the environment [39]. For example, some bacteria may escape from the tumor site and colonize other tissues or organs, causing unwanted side effects or complications, or some bacteria may acquire or transfer resistance genes from or to other bacteria, creating superbugs that are difficult to treat [46, 47]. To address these issues, researchers have devised various strategies to control and monitor the behavior of bacteria in cancer therapy, such as attenuation (modifying the bacteria to reduce their virulence or pathogenicity), targeting (modifying the bacteria to enhance their specificity or affinity for tumor cells), and imaging (modifying the bacteria to enable their visualization or tracking in vivo) [46]. Another challenge is ensuring the efficacy of bacteria in cancer therapy, as they are living organisms that can interact with the host and the environment in complex and dynamic ways, facing various obstacles or limitations that affect their performance or outcome in vivo [48]. For example, some bacteria may encounter immune responses that prevent them from reaching or invading the tumor site, or some bacteria may fail to deliver sufficient amounts of anti-cancer agents to tumor cells or induce adequate immune responses against tumor cells [48].</p>
                        
                        <p>In addition to ensuring the safety and efficacy of bacteria in cancer therapy, researchers have also devised various strategies to enhance and optimize their function and activity. These include combination (combining bacteria with other treatments or agents that can synergize or complement their effects), cooperation (using multiple types of bacteria that can cooperate or coordinate their actions), and evolution (using adaptive or directed evolution techniques to select or engineer bacteria that have improved or desired traits) [49]. A final challenge is to ensure the regulation and ethics of bacteria in cancer therapy, as they are living organisms that can have unpredictable or unintended consequences for the host or the environment, raising various ethical or social concerns that need to be addressed before their clinical application [50]. These include preclinical testing (conducting rigorous and comprehensive experiments in vitro and in animal models to evaluate the safety and efficacy of bacteria in cancer therapy), clinical trials (conducting systematic and ethical studies in human volunteers or patients to confirm the safety and efficacy of bacteria in cancer therapy), and post-marketing surveillance (monitoring and reporting the long-term effects and outcomes of bacteria in cancer therapy) [51]. </p>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
                        
                        <p>Bacteria are emerging as powerful allies in the fight against cancer, offering advantages over conventional treatments such as specificity, penetration, delivery, and modulation, as well as the potential to overcome challenges such as resistance, recurrence, and metastasis. However, bacteria also have limitations and risks, facing similar hurdles as conventional treatments in terms of safety, efficacy, and regulation, as well as unique challenges such as immune evasion, bacterial clearance, and ethical issues. Therefore, more research and development are needed to optimize and validate the use of bacteria in cancer therapy, requiring multidisciplinary collaboration among scientists, engineers, clinicians, regulators, and patients. Recent advances in genetic engineering and nanotechnology have enabled the creation of novel bacterial platforms that can be controlled and monitored in vivo, as well as combined or cooperated with other treatments or agents to enhance their function and activity. A final challenge is to ensure the regulation and ethics of bacteria in cancer therapy, as they are living organisms that can have unforeseen or unwanted impacts on the host or the environment, raising various ethical or social issues that need to be resolved before their clinical use. Bacteria are not foes; they are allies. They have coexisted with us since the origin of life, and they have influenced our evolution and health. Now, they may assist us in defeating one of our biggest enemies: cancer.</p>
