                        <p>Imagine being told that Darwin's Theory of evolution is wrong? And that everything you learned in biology class isn’t true? I know it’s difficult to believe, but scientists from all across the world are claiming that Darwin’s theory of evolution is false.</p>
                        
                        <p>A common misconception is the difference between a theory and an axiom. A self-evident truth is defined as an axiom. It is a logical assertion that is assumed to be correct. While, theory, on the other hand, is founded on empirical evidence. It is a hypothesis that has developed over time. It is changeable when new information comes to light but an axiom is a truth taken for granted within the particular domain of analysis and serves as the starting point for deducting and inferring other (theory and domain dependent) truth.</p>
                        
                        <p>Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution biologically explains how different creatures have developed progressively through natural selection over eons of time from microscopic organisms to organisms of today. According to Mario Seiglie, a believer of Creationism, the theory of evolution is not microevolution – small changes in the species but macroevolution, the change of one type of creature to another distinct life form.</p>
                        
                        <p>It is mathematically impossible for something as sophisticated as a protein, let alone a living cell or a human, to arise by random. Moreover, evolution does not even explain how life first appeared on Earth.</p>
                        
                        <p>Animals and plants have adapted to the earth’s environment. Animal fur, for example, is used to live in cold and severe conditions, while humps on a camel’s back are used to store fat, which breaks down into water and energy when food and water are scarce. Mangrove tree pneumatophores and cactus spines are excellent examples of this.</p>
                        
                        <p>On the other hand, if human beings are taken into account, it is very clear that they do not adapt to the environment they live in. In an article published in Daily Star, Dr. Ellis Silver stated, “Mankind is purportedly the most advanced species on the planet, yet it is strangely unsuited and poorly equipped for Earth’s environment: damaged by sunshine, a strong disdain for naturally existing foods, a crazily high rate of chronic diseases, and more”. The difficulty of childbirth, he claimed, was further substantiation of his beliefs.</p>
                        
                        <p>Dr. Silver backed up his assertion by pointing out that people frequently suffer from terrible backs, which he claimed was due to life evolving in a lower-gravity environment. According to Silver, there isn’t a single individual who is completely well and isn’t suffering from some sort of ailment or disorder that is either concealed or unspoken.</p>
                        
                        <p>According to the theory of natural selection, features that may be passed down enable animals to adapt to their environment more effectively than other members of their own species. This makes it possible for them to survive and reproduce better than other members of the species, which causes evolution. However, since human adaptations cannot be found, it can be said that there was no evolution in the case of humans.</p>
                        
                        <p>According to the Second Law of Thermodynamics, systems must become increasingly disordered over time. Inanimate substances could not have evolved into living cells and protozoa could not have evolved into multicellular life. Moreover mutations can only be used to delete qualities.</p>
                        
                        <p>Recent discoveries show that life, even at the microscopic level, has a level of complexity that could not have evolved.</p>
                        
                        <p>The problem with this theory is that it is not testable or falsifiable. It makes claims about events that were not observed and can never be re-created. Yet again we come back to the same question- Should we believe in Darwin's Theory? Research is underway and surely we would be able to know if Charles Darwin was right in his claims or not.</p>
