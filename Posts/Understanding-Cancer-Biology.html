                        <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>When we hear the word "cancer," our bodies quickly numb, and our minds tend to drift toward all the negative traits associated with the genetic disease. As a society, we've grown familiar with the word as well as the emotions that are accompanied by its diagnosis. However, how much do you know about its physiology? How much do you know about its origins and the data of researchers who've explored its pathophysiology in great depth? Together, let's explore the biology of cancer in the context of Otto Warburg's phenomenal research into its biological effects on optimal function.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">What is Cancer?</h2>
                        <p>Cancer refers to the spread of a tumor, which may be benign or malignant, with the latter being the more ominous case. Tumors are classified as the development of an abnormal mass due to the proliferation of cells. If a tumor spreads, it may compress the tissues surrounding it and impair organ functions depending on its location (i.e., colon, brain, lungs, etc.). Organ impairment resulting from the tumor's spread may be fatal though not nearly as lethal as the metastasis of a malignant tumor. Metastasis occurs when tumor cells separate from the initial site of the tumor to another location via the lymphatic system or blood vessels. In general, cancers lack the proper growth regulation mechanisms demonstrated by other tissues in the human body. Once cells deviate from standard growth control regulations, our genetic machinery is significantly impacted; however, the same effect may be caused by viruses and toxins in the environment, among many other causes. Clinically, illness from cancer usually begins once a tumor invades and ravages the healthy tissues surrounding it, hindering our bodies' physiological capabilities.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">What is The Warburg Effect?</h2>
                        <p>A common mechanism in cancer cells is their ability to rewire their metabolism to facilitate growth and cell proliferation. Interestingly enough, increased uptake in glucose and fermentation of glucose to lactate has been observed in this mechanism cancers utilize to survive. This biological phenomenon has been documented for decades and has even been observed in the presence of fully functioning mitochondria.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Examining the Data & Current Hypotheses</h2>
                        <div>
                            <img class="illus-img" src="../assets/others/understanding_cancer_biology_jared.png">
                        </div>
                        <p>When we examine the data above, we must ask ourselves how oxygen and ATP production use differ from normal and ascites cancer cells. For instance, in normal liver and kidney cells, the oxidative ATP is 4.69, but in ascites cancer cells, the oxidative ATP is 2.19, which is remarkably less than expected. In addition, in the observed normal liver and kidney cells, glycolytic ATP production (micro-mol/h/mg/tissue) was 0.0450 and 0.94 for glycolytic ATP contribution production (%). However, in ascites cancer cells, the glycolytic ATP production & ATP contribution production were 2.68 and 55, respectively, which is significantly greater than average. </p>
                        <p>In Warburg’s studies, he noticed that cancer cells used a lot of glucose but did not produce a lot of CO<sub>2</sub>. Hence, he hypothesized that cancer was caused by damaged and hindered respiratory ability (associated with the mitochondria). To test his hypothesis, Warburg isolated the respiratory membranes of mouse and human cancer cells to test whether they could produce ATP when supplied with pyruvate. In his experiment, they were unable to produce ATP when provided with pyruvate, thus “confirming” his hypothesis. Though, we must remember that although cancer cells <i>sometimes</i> have mitochondrial defects, not <i>all</i> cancers have these defects, even though almost all cancers are glycolytic and fermentative.</p>
                        <p>There are three current hypotheses regarding why cancer cells demonstrate Warburg metabolism, each with evidence supporting and undermining the hypothesized explanations for these phenomena. 1) Cancer cells may need to conserve biomass. Proliferating cells don’t just require ATP; they also need to make proteins, fats, nucleic acids, and carbohydrates, so they need carbon. Cancer cells switch to glycolysis and fermentation to conserve carbon compounds. Other proliferative cells also have high glycolytic rates. However, most of the lactate produced by cancer cells is secreted, so how does this conserve carbon biomass? 2) Young cancers are poorly vascularized. “Successful” cancers will switch to a metabolic mode that doesn’t require O<sub>2</sub>.</p>
                        <p>However, this hypothesis is undermined by the fact that leukemia cells are very “glycolytic” (fermenting) even though in well-oxygenated blood. 3) Mitochondrial defects (Warburg’s original hypothesis). The mitochondria (respiratory membranes) of cancer cells often have defects, though this hypothesis is undermined by the fact that not all cancers have these defects, but most are indeed glycolytic.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>Though there is still so much we don’t quite understand about cancer physiology, our current understanding of the data and underlying mechanisms in which it functions has allowed researchers to develop various auspicious cancer therapies involving our immune cells. These immune cells can be stimulated to recognize and destroy tumor cells without causing havoc to the surrounding tissue. Other treatments under study include ceasing the blood supply to a tumor to starve it to death and drugs that inhibit the development of blood vessels, such as Avastin (bevacizumab) and thalidomide. These promising new therapies to address various cancers should give the public hope that one day we just might conquer this devastating disease.</p>
