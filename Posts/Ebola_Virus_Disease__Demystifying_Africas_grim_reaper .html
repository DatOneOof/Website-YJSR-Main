                            <p>An illness so severe it brings terror to all those around it.</p>
                            <p>Such was the case for Dr. Adaora Igonoh, a Nigerian doctor who contracted the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) after unknowingly treating an infected Liberian man. After physicians discovered his condition, every staff member of the Lagos hospital was placed on lockdown. 11 days after exposure, Igonoh would discover she was sick with EVD. It would be an arduous two weeks, filled with vomiting, diarrhea, a high fever, joint and muscle aches, and eye pain, before Igonoh would make her recovery. </p>
                            <p>EVD, or Ebola hemorrhagic fever, is a sharply fatal illness in humans, transmitted via physical contact with contaminated bodily fluids or objects. Its biological source, the Ebolavirus genus, is a single, negative-sense RNA strand, formed by 19,000 nucleotides.  Structurally, the molecular composition of Ebola viruses are almost identical to that of Marburg viruses, another closely related virus that is also known to inflict deadly disease among humans.  Ebola virus is the progenitor of six viral species: Zaire ebolavirus, Sudan ebolavirus, Reston ebolavirus, Tai Forest ebolavirus, Bundibugyo ebolavirus, and Bombali ebolavirus, each named for the location of their discovery. The Zaire, Sudan, Bundibugyo, and Tai Forest ebola viruses are all known to be pathogenic and infect humans with EVD. The Reston and Bombali ebola viruses are not known to cause disease in humans.  All of the species in the Ebolavirus genus require Biosafety Level-4 handling – the highest level of caution required when managing pathogenic organisms.</p>
                            <p>Ebolavirus can enter tissues through gaps in the skin or airways, infecting the human host with EVD. In its initial stages, EVD symptoms may include fever, muscle pains, and headache, until eventually progressing into a gastrointestinal bout of diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration. The patient’s condition around the end of this period, usually about  the second week of infection, determines whether they will recover or not. Patients with worsening symptoms may experience bleeding or collapse, which usually results in death.  Patients who recover can expect a long three-month process of extreme hydration and fluid management, with treatments continuing on until 91 days after symptoms first appeared.  </p>
                            <p>Given the severity of EVD, it comes as no surprise to epidemiologists and public health officials alike when Ebola regularly tops the lists of the most deadly African diseases. Ebola has one of the most scarring set of symptoms of any recent endemic infection. Sights of paralyzing myalgia, profuse emesis, and horrific internal bleeding work to produce a reputation of tragedy and sorrow in areas where the disease is endemic. And those who overcome the malady do not overcome the social stigma it carries; many EVD survivors are sentenced to a life of fear and rejection from their families and local communities. After staring death in the face for weeks on end, recovered patients must grapple with the label of being ‘contaminated’ by their peers, leading to rejection from society due to ignorance and fear.</p>
                            <p>The damage EVD inflicts on local communities runs deeper than any casualty count. The illness tugs at the very core of communal function; the ability to converse, trust, and rely on one’s fellow man. Anti-EVD counter measures must be implemented with both biological and sociological factors in mind. Regulations limiting the spread of possible infectants, encouraging rigorous hydration, and increasinging the count of physicians would do well in reducing both the case number and death rate of EVD. Additionally, government officials should aim to expand education on Ebolavirus, emphasizing its transmission through physical contact and fighting the false perceptions surrounding EVD survivors. These procedures serve to tackle the spread of Ebola whilst simultaneously improving the lives of recovered individuals. Through evidence-based policy and compassionate aid for affected communities, EVD can be drastically reduced in Africa. Through hopeful optimism and unbreakable endurance, Africa’s grim reaper may be effectively curtailed once and for all.</p>
