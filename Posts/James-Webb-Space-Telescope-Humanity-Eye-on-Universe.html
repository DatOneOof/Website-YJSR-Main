                        <p>The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is the largest and most powerful infrared space telescope that’s ever developed. It has four main goals: the very beginning of the universe, the birth of stars, planets, and the origins of life, assembly of galaxies in the early universe. It was produced under the leadership of NASA and with contributions from the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency and was launched on Ariane Flight VA256 on December 25, 2021 [1].<br><br>
  It’s been almost 2 years since the JWST was sent to its orbit, the L2 Lagrange point, which is a gravitationally stable location in space but it has discovered things that Hubble couldn't for more than 30 years.
</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">James Webb Space Telescope’s Technical Specifications</h2>
                        <p>Webb draws its unprecedented strength from the size of the primary mirror and the extremely sensitive four science instruments:<br><br>
  [2]Research telescopes like the JWST include scientific instruments that optimize observations for use in any scientific purpose. Webb has four instruments: MIRI, NIRCam, NIRSpec, and NIRISS/FGS. Each of them includes a set of specialized components besides their common components among research telescopes.<br><br>
                            All of the instruments have <b>cameras</b> to capture two-dimensional near-infrared (NIRCam and NIRISS) and mid-infrared (MIRI) images of space, except NIRSpec.<br><br>
  All instruments have <b>spectrographs</b> that are designed differently for different purposes.<br><br>
  NIRCam and MIRI have coronagraphs that are used as a block the light of the stars through their opaque being. They detect the much fainter light of planets and debris disks orbiting the star.<br><br>
  Also, they have numerous types of filters to transmit a clear range of wavelengths of light and block all others like broad-band filters, narrow-band filters, and more.<br><br>
  On the other hand, each instrument has two detectors to absorb light and convert it into electrical charges so that the information is carried in the light.<br><br>
  These are Webb’s and the other telescope’s common components. Also, Webb’s instruments include more specialized components:<br><br>  
                            Only NIRSpec has a <b>micro-shutter array (MSA)</b> that’s a grid of 248,000 small doors that open and close to capture the spectra of 100 objects or points in space simultaneously by controlling the transmission or blocking of light to capture hundreds of colorful spectra at the same time. Additionally, Webb is the only space telescope with an MSA.<br><br>
  NIRSpec and MIRI have the <b>integral field unit (IFU)</b> that is a combination of camera and spectrograph to map spectra across a field of view to understand variation over space.<br><br>
  Last but not least, only NIRISS has an <b>aperture mask</b> to get more detailed images of extremely bright objects effectively.<br><br>
  The other important specification of the telescope is the design of the mirrors: We can see Webb has a special mirror design at first glance and the way you deep dive, understand the incredible work with the mirrors. Webb has an innovative primary mirror made of ultra-lightweight beryllium and designed 18 separate segments that can fold and unfold to change the shape during its mission. It’s impressive work because each mirror is aligned to 1/10,000th the thickness of a human hair to align the all segments to seem like a single giant mirror moreover, it has to sense any errors that could happen in case making the 18 mirrors work together as one in the telescope’s optics. Furthermore, the mirrors are built lightweight to alleviate the whole weight.<br><br>
  Lastly, Webb faces so much heat because of the Sun. It carries cryocooler and sun shield coatings that are a tennis court-sized five-layer to protect itself from heat coming from the Sun more than a million times.
</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">How does Webb Take those Greatest Images?</h2>
                        <p>Webb telescope has taken many wonderful images from the day it was sent to space. All of them have been planned to get. Therefore, it has observing modes to find your direct target and answers to important scientific questions.<br><br>
  We see excellent colorful images of the stars, nebules, and different galaxies. However, in reality, Webb doesn’t take images with colors. The images in black and white font are sent to Earth and after a lot of work to highlight a variety of useful scientific information and then it become the way we see them in a good look.
</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Scientific Discoveries</h2>
                        <p>Scientists and engineers aim to learn every phase in the history of our Universe and possible live forms and exoplanets in solar systems or distant galaxies. Furthermore, it gives hope to find worlds that have the potential to host life. They are looking for Earth-sized planets that are around small stars, what we call M dwarfs, cool stars that are not like our sun. They’ve made big progress toward it. For instance, it detected carbon dioxide for the first time through the infrared capabilities of JWST in WASP-39 b that is named “hot Jupiter” in a year. It’s not the only discovery of particles on the other planet. [5] Thousand-mile-per-hour winds are blowing a hail of tiny quartz crystals through the silicate-enhanced, scorching hot atmosphere of a distant gas giant planet called WASP-17b, the Webb telescope has found, in last month. [6] Also, it has spied planet-forming disks letting off a cold "steam," providing crucial evidence for a leading theory describing how planets are built.<br><br>
  In conclusion, having touch with 13 billion years of history is incredible for humanity. Some traces in the early universe have already been seen. It seems more possible to get in touch with 13 billion years of the history of the universe than ever. We can’t just call it a “telescope”, it’s exactly a time machine. JWST has already exceeded expectations and worked very well out of the box. All it’s done so far is almost nothing compared to what it’ll do in its nearly expected 20-year life.
