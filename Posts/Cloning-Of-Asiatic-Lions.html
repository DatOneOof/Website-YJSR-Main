                        <p>Asiatic lions (<i>panthera leo persica</i>) are a lion subspecies found exclusively in the Gir National Park in the Indian state of Gujarat. Historically, the species was found in the Middle East, Western Asia and North India but severe poaching by Indian royalty and colonial powers in the 20th century has resulted in a huge decline in their numbers. Large scale droughts in the Middle East and extensive wars and firearm usage in Western Asia also contributed to the eradication of the species in specific regions. In 2018, a deadly combination of Canine Distemper Virus (CDV) and babesiosis wiped out large numbers of lions from the Gir National Park as well.</p>
                        
                        <p>Cloning is the process of producing individuals of identical Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) to another organism, either artificially or naturally, in this case artificially. As the number of Asiatic lions found in the world has reduced to a mere 600, cloning can be looked at as a possible solution to increase their numbers. As the process of cloning requires injecting egg cells from a donor into a surrogate inside whom the cloned animal is allowed to develop, the African Lion can be a possible surrogate because it is of the same species as the Asiatic Lion.</p>
                        
                        <p>The number of female Asiatic lions as compared to that of males is relatively higher (201 females and 109 males according to the 2017 census), thus making it difficult for females to find mates. By selectively cloning male Asiatic lions, their number can be increased so that females have a higher probability of finding mates and chances of reproduction will increase. This will help increase the dwindling numbers of the species.</p>
                        
                        <p>As the Asiatic lion population is confined to a limited area, there is a huge threat of mass extinction by a disease or virus. If such a case tends to happen, it is very likely that the entire population will be wiped out at once, especially because canine viruses tend to be highly infectious. The Supreme Court of India tried relocating a few Asiatic lions to the Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary in Madhya Pradesh (central India), but was unable to do so due to political conflicts between the state and the court. The Gujarat government has been reluctant to part with the lions because they are considered a “cultural symbol” of the state and the government believes that the lions will not be able to adapt to the change in geographical conditions. Looking at Botswana where almost 350 elephants died due to an unidentified virus in the waters of the Okavango Delta in July 2020, it is possible that Asiatic lions may suffer a similar fate in future.</p>
                        
                        <p>In this case, cloning can be a plausible solution. The cloned Asiatic lions could be translocated to the Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary and allowed to reproduce and establish their own pride in the sanctuary. This will reduce risks of mass extinction as even if one of the either lion populations gets affected by a virus, it is likely that the other population will be able to survive and continue the species.</p>
                        
                        <p>However, Asiatic lions are a genetically homogenous species that are highly inbred. Cloning the organism will make it very difficult to find genetically diverse lions as the species already has low genetic variations. In future, it is highly probable that the species will face extinction due to large scale gene mutations in their DNA, which will develop overtime due to lack of genetic diversity and cloning will contribute to this happening as it increases lack of variations. Attempts to clone the Asiatic cheetah, another highly inbred species, proved to be a failure as the species has become so genetically similar due to dwindling numbers that the cheetah’s immunity system failed to reject skin allografts from an unrelated cheetah donor. It is quite likely that cloning Asiatic lions will produce similar results.</p>
                        
                        <p> Asiatic lions are also confined to a very small area and are highly overpopulated. Due to the government's refusal to translocate the lions, there is a high possibility that they may protest against relocating the clones as well. If that happens, the lion population of Gir National Park will become uncontrolled and the species may end up becoming extinct due to excessive competition for food and space.</p>
                        
                        <p>It must also be noted that cloning is an expensive procedure and will deplete a lot of funds from the concerned state government. Even if successful, suitable habitats need to be determined and developed for the clones as keeping them in Gir is not an option due to overpopulation. This would also impact settlements near the chosen habitat and cause large scale displacement of people in order to develop a habitat for the lions, thus increasing economic load on the government.</p>
                        
                        <p>Animals involved in cloning also undergo a lot of pain and suffering and the surrogate tends to face obstetrical complications, during and before pregnancy. According to Darwin’s theory of natural selection, only the fittest organisms survive and the fact that nature is no longer aiding in repopulating Asiatic lions, might be an indicator that the species is no longer considered fit to survive. Not only that, but if cloning of Asiatic lions becomes successful, focus will shift from preservation to cloning as people will view cloning as a solution rather than trying to conserve endangered species, resulting in a huge loss of animal lives.</p>
                        
                        <p>In my opinion, translocating the lions to a habitat similar to Gir will be a better alternative than cloning. The same amount of funds needed for cloning can be utilised in translocating a few Asiatic lions to Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary. This will reduce chances of mass extinction due to disease and also prevent overpopulation. Translocation has also been proved to be a success in the past. Baboons translocated from farmland to their natural habitat in Kenya in 1984, showed increase in reproduction rates, improvements in body conditions, did better in their new homes, and the declining population was saved. Thus, translocation of Asiatic lions is likely to be the best possible solution in order to preserve the species.</p>
