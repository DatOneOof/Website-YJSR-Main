                        <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>If the question “What is an artist’s most important ability?” is asked, most people would respond with imagination. While that is in fact true for a majority of artists, a minority of them do not have the ability to visualize. There are aspects of experience that differ between individuals, contributing to the wide spectrum of mindsets and behaviors. One of them is the varying capacities of visual imagery vividness, or in other words, mental imagery.</p>
                        <p>Sir Fransis Galton, who pioneered the quantitative study of visual imaging, first found this phenomena in the 1800s, when he stated the enormous variance in individuals' subjective vividness. This occurrence was mostly ignored until the early 2000s, when Dr. Adam Zeman, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Exeter in England, began exploring and coining terms for the spectrum. Using the Greek word “Phantasia'' -imagination- he coined the terms “aphantasia” and “hyperphantasia”. Aphantasia refers to the inability to create mental images, and on the other side of the spectrum lies hyperphantasia; referring to when one experiences exceptionally vivid mental pictures.</p>
                        <p>After Dr. Zeman's discovery, it was ascertained that around 2-3 percent of the population suffers from aphantasia, and a slightly greater percentage suffers from hyperphantasia (Zeman, 2020). This research aims to raise awareness about aphantasia and how it affected artists’ abilities during the past two decades.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Literature Review</h2>
                        <h3>Visual Imagery Vividness Extremes</h3>
                        <p>In most cases, visual imaging allows us to see abstract elements in our minds including memory, daydreaming, and creativity. The frontal and parietal lobes of the brain are involved in perception, and changes anywhere in the system might be the reason for this phenomenon. Voluntary imagery is linked to activity in the fronto-parietal 'executive' systems and posterior brain regions, which together allow us to produce images based on our previously acquired knowledge of appearances.</p>
                        <p>Scientist Crawform Winlove, spoke about how scientists are now able to pinpoint where the neural substrate of visual imagery is essentially housed in the brain. It appears that the Primary Visual Cortex (V1) is core to the visual processing in the brain. Joel Pearson (Researcher), discovered that persons with aphantasia use this portion of the brain when looking at something directly in front of them, but not when envisioning or recalling anything, or at a considerably lower level than the general population (Bracely & Robinson, 2020). Thankfully, Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) have helped to generate a considerable amount of information concerning the brain foundation of visual mental representations.</p>
                        <p>During resting-state fMRI, people suffering from hyperphantasia had more connections between prefrontal cortices and the visual network than aphantasic people (Milton et al., 2021). Among healthy people, the vividness of self-reported visual imagery varies greatly. Aside from normal variance, the literature suggests that vividness can be influenced by a variety of pathological and pharmacological causes. Furthermore, it can be dimmed or abolished by brain injury, depression, anxiety and depersonalisation, whereas imagery is heightened in psychopathologies such as post-traumatic stress disorder and by hallucinogens like mescaline and LSD (Zeman, Dewar & Della Sala, 2016).</p>
                        <p><b>Fields of both extremes.</b> High trait vividness scores are correlated with increased performance on certain cognitive problems, such as identifying degraded figures, and are heavily represented among artists; high "spatial imagery" scores, on the other hand, are associated with enhanced performance in visuospatial tasks and are overrepresented among scientists, according to studies focusing on the vividness of "object imagery." People with aphantasia were more likely to work in scientific or mathematical domains, whereas those with hyperphantasia were more likely to work in "artistic" fields (Milton et al., 2021).</p>
                        <h3>Aphantasia</h3>
                        <p><b>Introduction.</b> The term "aphantasia" is a relatively new term. Adam Zeman officially founded it in 2015. Aristotle uses the word "phantasia" to characterize fantasy, and the professor adds a "a" to denote a negative or lacking connotation. As a result, aphantasia refers to a mental condition in which patients are unable to concentrate on visualizing or remembering images (Gallagher, 2019). Unlike other mental diseases, aphantasia is not linked to disorientation, stress, mood swings, or any other common signs of hallucination  (Yang, 2022).</p>
                        <p>The study of a patient named MX, which directs researchers in the direction that aphantasia may be caused by damage, is the most groundbreaking and impactful aphantasia research that needs to be explored. MX had a minor operation in 2009 and then discovered that he could no longer imagine images in his head (Reeves, 2009). MX sought assistance from Adam Zeman, a neurologist at the University of Exeter. However, this psychiatrist has combed through nearly all of the medical literature and found that none of them can explain why this person is unable to generate visual images in his head. As a result, many individuals with the same condition discovered that they couldn't visualize anything, but the difference was that most people are born brain-blind. The prevalence of aphantasia is higher among first-degree relatives, suggesting a hereditary component to visual vividness (Milton et al., 2021). In a study titled Phantasia – The psychological repercussions of lifelong visual imagery vividness extremes, Zeman discovered that those with aphantasia were ten times more likely than those in the control group to have a first-degree relative with aphantasia. His research team believes that there are multiple genetic ties to congenital aphantasia and is looking for genes that might be involved.</p>
                        <h3>How Aphantasia Affects Artists and Their Adaptations</h3>
                        <p><b>Introduction.</b> Being a visual artist and not being able to visualize appears to be a contradiction. This is based on long-held preconceptions about how artists operate and this corresponds with the popular belief that visual artists employ their imagination to create their work. When compared to creators who can envision, artists with aphantasia make work that ranges from photo realistic to abstract, conjuring rich detail as well as provocative ambiguity while revealing little-to-no externally evident difference or consequences. For many, a major part of drawing will rely on imagination; however, for an artist suffering from aphantasia, other forms of artistic processes are required. At an artists’ panel at the Extreme Imagination conference the importance of issues, such as close looking, paying attention, parasotocal painting, and segregating the image into further parts, was discussed by artists who recounted personal anecdotes and coping mechanisms for being able to make artworks whilst having aphantasia (Bracely & Robinson, 2020).</p>
                        <p><b>Knowing vs Picturing.</b> Many of the painters who endure aphantasia questioned and stressed this feature of their creative process: although mental vision occurs totally within the brain, sketching occurs entirely beyond it. In other words, drawing heavily depends on muscle memory that is trained to work in a feedback loop consisting of sketching, perceiving, and modifying until the lines reach the standard of the artist. Fortunately, it has been discovered that aphantasics retain such standards.``MX," the subject of the first case study of acquired aphantasia, could describe sceneries and landmarks in his hometown of Edinburgh in great detail. In other words, there is a difference between imagining and knowing what something looks rather than purely sketching it down. As the psychologist of art Rudolf Arnheim noted, a draftsperson working from memory “may deny convincingly that he has anything like an explicit picture of [the object] in his mind”—yet, as he works, the correctness of what he is producing on paper is judged and modified according to some standard in the mind. ("The unusual creative process of the artist behind ‘The Little Mermaid’ and ‘Beauty and the Beast’”, 2021).</p>
                        <p><b>Parasitical painting.</b> Due to their neuro-psychological limitations, aphantatic artists often coincide with the dependency on external, environmental, structures to generate artwork. This dependence usually comes in the form of copying directly from a certain source or using parasitic painting and adjusting other artists' artwork. Nicolas Bourriaud, a curator and writer, outlines how an increasing number of artists are creating new works of art by repurposing old pictures and materials. When a person is unable to visualize, a digital image might serve as a substitute memory. The digital picture may be viewed as a conduit for retrieving information from the brain's memory. In other words, the loss caused by the incapacity to see is somewhat offset by access to a massive and easily accessible digital collection of pictures.Curator and writer, Nicolas Bourriaud describes how an increasing number of artists are crafting new works of art by using existing images and objects as material (Bracely & Robinson, 2020).</p>
                        <p><b>Looking Attentively.</b> Tagging is a memory method described by people with congenital aphantasia. They immediately recognize the image's distinctive qualities and produce a verbal description that they memorize for future usage using this method (Yang, 2022). This might involve an encounter with an artwork in which you engage in an active connection "with" it. The active relationship is focused on paying close attention to a painting in order to both give and receive from it. Given the aphant's incapacity to envision, attitudes associated with attentive viewing, such as slowing down to pay attention and immersing oneself in an active contemplation of a picture, are not out of the question. This can also take the form of attitudes that divide the artwork into several components (emotional meaning, anatomy/dissection of the object,  colors/shadows, etc).</p>
                        <h3>Aphantatic Artists</h3>
                        <p><b>Ed Catmull.</b> Ed Catmull, cofounder of Pixar Animation Studios and president of Walt Disney and Pixar Animation Studios, ironically discovered he had aphantasia when a friend asked him to picture a sphere in his head. “I spent a week trying,” he said, “but when I closed my eyes, I just couldn’t conjure up a sphere in front of me. I have a physics degree and a strong sense of 3D. My creation set the industry standard for animating curves, yet I couldn’t see a sphere in my mind.” Inspired by the Dr. Zeman's phantasia test, Ed conducted a survey of more than 500 employees from various professions for his colleagues at Pixar. "I realized I had unique access to some of the world's best visual creators as well as some of the world's most technical minds, so I did some research on them." While some people had such good visual imagination that they could "trace" their thoughts onto a page, he rapidly realized that some of the most gifted people could not. ("Research news - World’s largest gathering for people with no ‘mind’s eye’ takes place in Exeter - University of Exeter'', 2019).</p>
                        <p><b>Glen Keane.</b> Winner of an Academy Award, Glen Keane, the creator of classic characters such as Ariel, Rapunzel, and the Beast, is one of the most well-known painters without visual imagery. He now believes that having aphantasia has little to no bearing on one's creative ability. To create his figures, Keane draws on his surroundings as well as his understanding of creative standards. He starts with what he calls an "explosion of scribbles," then highlights and subtracts lines until he achieves the desired form.It took a similar amount of trial and error to design the Beast. Keane began by imitating the buffalo head that hung in his studio, then experimenting with traits from other animals, such as a gorilla's brow and a lion's mane ("The unusual creative process of the artist behind ‘The Little Mermaid’ and ‘Beauty and the Beast’", 2021).</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>Many people have identified where they fall on the visual imagery vividness spectrum by taking the VVIQ, or Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire, which analyzes the vividness of your visual imagination. The current study on this topic is still in its early stages, and it can only offer some research directions and major issues. There is currently insufficient published research to indicate what causes aphantasia. It's unknown whether environmental causes like toxin incursion or genetic variables like mutations play a role in this mental disease. First and foremost, is there a subtype of aphantasia? If aphantasia appears to have numerous subtypes, it is unclear if it represents a permanent extreme distinct state or a group of States (Yang, 2022). Next, even though aphantasia has proven not to be physically harmful towards a person suffering from aphantasia; however, research on potential treatments should be conducted to further aid the comfortability of individuals. With one in 50 people having what is called Aphantasia, the inability to voluntarily create a mental picture in your head,the art and neurological communities have merged. Artists suffering from aphantasia, though many doubt their abilities, have proven that they can dominate the art industry using innovative and unique artistic processes that cater to their needs. Thus, modern society should learn from the minority and find innovative solutions to modern day problems as well as work on forgetting toxic and outdated speculations and stereotypes.</p>
