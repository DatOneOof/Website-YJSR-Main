                        <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>HM, Henry Molaison, has become one of the most known case studies in the field of neurology. Born in 1926, Henry suffered from epilepsy, and dealt with severe seizures for a period of ten years. He underwent surgical procedures, until eventually time stood still for him on September 1, 1953.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Early Life</h2>
                        <p>HM began to have minor seizures at age 10, years after he was knocked down by a bicycle at age 7. After he turned 16, he began experiencing increments in severity in his seizures. After entering his adult life, and working in an assembly line, he was forced to be incapacitated, despite the different medications (ex: anticonvulsant medication) he was taking to reduce the severity of his seizures.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">What surgical procedures were done to HM?</h2>
                        <p>HM had tissue from both sides of his brain removed, about a thumb-sized section. The surgeons believed the removal of sections in the medial temporal lobe, including the hippocampus and other areas, would ease the frequent seizures. William Beecher Scoville, and other surgeons had performed the experimental procedure previously on psychotic patients, so they were expecting it to be effective.</p>

                        <p class="img-cap"><b>Figure 1:</b> Comparision of Henry Molaison's brain (right) with a regular brain (left).</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">What was the outcome?</h2>
                        <p>The procedure, in appearance, turned out to be effective in easing the seizures, putting them to a complete stop. The seizures stopped occurring, until it was found he developed permanent amnesia. He was left unable to form new memories, and could slightly remember events from his childhood. The condition was distinguished as retrograde amnesia, and despite his inability to form new memories, his other mental capacities still worked at their fullest potential. He would still perform well regarding his motor skills and level of intelligence. For example, if HM were to learn how to knit consistently and practice it every day, his ability to knit would remain, but he would not be able to recall his memory of learning the skill itself.</p>
                        <p>Henry’s life became more difficult than it already was, living with retrograde amnesia. His loved ones surrounding him had to learn how to transition into this new way of living, where he would not be able to form new memories. He had to live with this condition until he died from respiratory failure in a nursing home in 2008, at 82 years old.</p>
                        <img class="illus-img" src="../assets/others/the_man_with_no_memory_mia (3).png">
                        <p class="img-cap"><b>Figure 2:</b> Henry Molaison</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">What was learned from HM’s case?</h2>
                        <p>Henry Molaison’s case allowed for a new endeavor to be researched more in depth: memory. Before his case study, it was believed memory and its functions were administered in the cerebral cortex, to be merged with perceptual and intellectual capacities. Throughout the period of his retrograde amnesia, HM revealed the way memory is unique in its cerebral functions, distinguishable from other cognitive and perceptual abilities. The medial lobe was also discovered to be important for memory.</p>
                        <p>After his death, his brain was studied, specifically using formalin to prevent decaying, and slicing 2,401 thin pieces, to be photographed and examined. A 3-D model was created, all conducted by scientists at the University of California at San Diego. Jacopo Annese and his colleagues were able to find large quantities of what is considered a healthy hippocampus. This finding was questioned as Scoville, HM’s surgeon, had indicated that the hippocampus and its surrounding structures had been removed. The leftover tissue behind the hippocampus was shown in the 3-D model, and it was proposed Scoville could have missed the region, as it was a curved-shaped structure following the top of the head, meaning the suction tube could have not matched the curve to remove the specified brain tissue.</p>

                        <p class="img-cap"><b>Figure 4</b> </p>
                        <p>MRI scans had revealed the presence of the hippocampus‘s residual tissue in the past, but not as much as the study revealed at UCSD. In Annese’s defense, the scans ”lacked the anatomical precision of the newer method,” and it led to the acknowledgment of the hippocampus not having a significant role in developing new memory, as it is proposed other structures surgically removed were needed to do so. In regards to the damage done to the brain, the entorhinal cortex removed was found to have an important role in forming new memories, due to the region serving as a signal relay station between the brain and hippocampus.</p>
                        <p>Even after Molaison’s tragic experience, it has allowed for the world of neuroscientists to grow, as his case study paved the way for advanced exploration of the brain. The creation and development of conscious and unconscious networks has been researched further because of HM, providing us with new kinds of knowledge within the realm of psychology and neuroscience.</p>
