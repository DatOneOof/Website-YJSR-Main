                        <h2 class="section-heading">The Butterfly Effect</h2>
                        
                        <p>Chaos theory is a principle which was built upon the butterfly effect: an idea that sprung to life by a meteorologist, Edward Lorenz, also referred to as the father of this theory. The butterfly effect is well known to be accompanied by the analogy: “<i>a butterfly flapping its wings in New Mexico could cause a hurricane in China</i>”. But, what exactly does that mean? Well, in other words, this analogy is proposing the idea that the results of a system or set of data are highly sensitive to any small changes made to the initial conditions. If that butterfly happened to flap its wing at just the right time in the right point in space, a hurricane might occur in China.</p>
                        
                        <p>Let’s look at this in another perspective. Hypothetically, a scientist is conducting an experiment to see where a ball would land if pushed off a hill. In this experiment, much like in every other, there are experimental errors prone to occur which would decrease its accuracy and precision.</p>
                        
                        <p>For instance, in the first trial, the scientist uses the same spot on the crest of the hill each time to push a ball off and then marks the object's position on the floor. No matter how many trials the scientist would conduct, the objects would not fall at the same position every time. In result, the scientist would not be able to predict any specific ball’s final position, but only the position where the balls are <i>most likely</i> to land.</p>
                        
                        <p>This is due to experimental errors, including the fact that one cannot take into account all the factors which fall into play during this specific scenerio. If it manages to hit something on its path down, is pushed with a different amount of Newtons, or starts rolling from a slightly different position, that small change would cause increasing errors which would eventually lead to a huge difference. As a result, it would tumble down an entirely different path; the butterfly effect. In short, there are too many variables to take into account in order to precisely predict the final position of the object.</p>
                        
                        <p>Because we can never know the “true” value of a quantity, we would never be able to <i>predict</i> the results of more complex systems where more factors are in play. These slight errors, slight changes in the initial conditions, lead to unpredictable results.</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">The Three Body Problem</h2>
                        
                        <p>By definition, chaos theory allows one to find order in chaos. It explains why chaotic/dynamic systems, which are sensitive to initial conditions, behave the way they do. Edward Lorenz saw this through his weather machine, but there was actually another chaotic system which was discovered long before he formed Chaos Theory.</p>
                        
                        <p>French mathematician Henri Poincaré showed in 1887 that while Newton's theory of gravity could accurately predict how two planetary bodies would orbit under the interaction of only gravity, the equations proved to be unsolvable if a third body was added. He explained that one of the reasons why this problem was unsolvable was due to the fact that small changes made at the beginning of this system would cause unbearable differences at the end. However, this idea was seen as false because many believed the universe was a deterministic system; the same input would always give the same output.</p>
                        
                        <p>Generally, the way physicists predict the motion of three bodies is by predicting their movements for every movement, and then use those predictions in equations. Using these assumptions and even ignoring some certain elements, scientists can approximate the solution to this problem. However, there is quite a gap between the predicted solution and the real solution, which is where chaos theory lies.</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">A Potential Solution</h2>
                        
                        <p>Two scientists may have found a potential solution for Newton’s Three Body Problem; using the theory of random walks also known as drunkard’s walk. This theory allows one to calculate the probability for an event to occur. Using a drunkard as an example, the steps one would take is randomized as there is an equal chance for them to step either left or right. By knowing these chances, it is possible to calculate the probability for the drunkard to end up in a specific position.</p>
                        
                        <p>Applying this theory to the Three Body Problem, the scientists calculated the probabilities for the speeds of the third body to calculate the final possibilities of what would occur within that three body system. An advantage of this solution is that since it focuses on probabilities of each interaction within the system, any additional forces are already accounted for; leading to a more precise outcome.</p>
