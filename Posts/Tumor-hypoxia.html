                        <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>Tumor-hypoxia is the main determinant in regard to the hindrance of post-radiotherapy treatment for many cancer patients. Hypoxia refers to the state of zero oxygen present within the body’s tissue and acts as a microenvironment that fosters metastasis. Researchers have gathered that in order to provide patients a greater chance of recovery, they must continue searching for methods to reduce and control tumor-hypoxia.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">What happens during tumor-hypoxia?</h2>
                        <p>The rapid growth and metastasizing of cancer is the main issue tumor-hypoxia brings to the table. However, there are other factors to take into consideration when surveying the impacts of hypoxia within the human body.</p>
                        <p>
                            These include:
                            <ol>
                                <li>Gene expression.</li>
                                <li>Cell metabolism.</li>
                                <li>Cancer-therapy resistance.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </p>
                        <p>Hypoxia interferes with the cell’s network and feedback loops, which goes hand in hand with the progression of the cells becoming less susceptible to the scope of postoperative treatment. The reprogramming of the cancerous cells prevents apoptosis from taking place, which further contributes to the difficulty of fully reducing the spread of the tumor.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Types Of Hypoxia</h2>
                        <p>Acute hypoxia and chronic hypoxia are the two different types of hypoxia that oncology researchers have found. Brief and immediate, acute hypoxia is reversible. The latter, chronic hypoxia, tends to carry out a longer cycle. Cancerous cells need multiple attributes to survive, and the two states of hypoxia allow for this to happen. Acute hypoxia provides the cells with the adaptation modifications it needs in order to flourish in the microenvironment. Chronic hypoxia allows for the cells to metastasize at a rapid rate.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Prognosis</h2>
                        <p>Due to the tedious nature of hypoxia and cancer itself, there has not yet been a “cure” to reverse the outcomes of tumor-hypoxia. Although there are compounds being tested in order to promote more oxygen permeability in cells, the eradication of tumor-hypoxia is not quite within our grasp. There are long-term issues that come with hypoxia, as it alters the essence of one’s DNA. However, the drugs that patients have available to them have shown to be effective in the sense that their body is more receptive to their treatment plan.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Treatment</h2>
                        <p>Varying drugs are currently in the works when it comes to treating hypoxia. Like all treatments, some are more effective than others. It has been noted that reducing the oxygen consumption rate brings about more efficiency in comparison to increasing delivery. There are a number of different cancers, and therefore, it is rather a case-by-case basis in which the survival rate of the patient and the reduction of the tumor will fluctuate. For instance, head and neck cancer cells responded quite well to treatment, but it is vital to note that they hold a low metastatic rate. External factors can play a role in the outcome of hypoxia treatment, as not every patient will be in a controlled environment that is identical to one another. Other propositions have been put forward to fight hypoxia, some of which include gene therapy and hypoxia-activated prodrugs. Establishing a strong understanding of the pathways through which hypoxia generates will enable the strongest outcomes of research in order to secure a stronger possibility of both primary and secondary prevention in the name of public health.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>Around twenty-five percent of fatalities in the United States are caused by cancer, and due to their dicey disposition, it is never exactly concrete what the fate of one’s journey might be. Despite this bleak statement, we are currently in the Golden Age of technology, and the relations between the medical and technological fields are being strengthened with each passing day. It is also important to remember that not all human tumors are considered to be hypoxic. Yet, it does not dismiss the overarching problem at hand. One can hope that the rapid progression of new equipment and procedures will allow for the birth of methods and machines that are suitable for sensitive cases such as tumor-hypoxia.</p>
