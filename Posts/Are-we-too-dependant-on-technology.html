                        <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>Debates frequently centre on the topic of "are we too dependent on technology." Many believe that people's reliance on technology has reached an unhealthy level. Others contend that technology is not necessary for human existence and that automation generally has beneficial impacts. This essay on technological reliance seeks to shed light on the issue of whether or not humans are unduly reliant on technology.</p>
                        <p>Technology is a useful tool. In fact, because technology is always improving, performing jobs is getting simpler. Notably, advances in medical technology have made it possible for doctors to save more lives.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">How Dependent Are We on Technology?</h2>
                        <p>Similar to this, the automation of important work processes suggests that not only is the workplace safer, but productivity is also higher. In fact, parents may communicate with their children who are studying abroad thanks to technology. Essentially, the use of technology has made individuals more globally connected. As it is, technology is required for every activity that individuals must take.</p>
                        <p>However, questions are being raised about technology use. First, the use of technology has boosted the availability of entertainment options for certain demographic groups, particularly young people who are addicted to their gadgets. Additionally, people's once-strong healthy habits are being drained by an overreliance on technology, which is creating a host of health problems. I agree that people have grown unduly reliant on technology on the basis of this assumption.</p>
                        <p>First, the usage of technology suggests that daily thought is decreasing. According to one study, the development of disorders like Alzheimer's and dementia in old age is slowed down by regular brain use. In actuality, children that play games like puzzles during their early years begin to grow their brains properly. Sadly, people in our generation don't use their brains as much as they should.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Reasons Why People Have Become Overly Dependent on Technology</h2>
                        <ol type="I">
							<h3><li>Dependence on Technology Leads to Less Thinking</li></h3>
							<p>In reality, individuals use calculators even for the most straightforward computations. It's no longer necessary to juggle one's memory in order to recall a friend's or relative's phone number. Now that phones can store contacts, people don't have to do all the thinking. As a result, people's mental capacity is dramatically lowered, which makes them more susceptible to dementia and memory loss as they age.</p>
							<p>However, how individuals utilise technology is the issue, not the technology itself. In essence, technology is designed to facilitate operations, boost productivity, and ease daily life. However, people abuse technology by using it for even the most straightforward tasks. Technology's contribution to society would be recognised and valued if it were used as a tool rather than an escape from reality.</p>
                            <h3><li>Dependence on Technology Leads to Less Meaningful Communication</li></h3>
							<p>In particular, word of mouth seems incredibly superfluous in light of how easy technology is. For instance, it is more likely that two friends in the same space may message one another rather than converse face-to-face. The majority of people now utilise devices like iPhones and iPads, which results in them spending a lot of time on social networking sites like Twitter and Facebook.</p>
							<p>As a result of being able to converse online and so limit physical touch, people are no longer able to meet and greet as they once did. Such an over-reliance on technology suggests that the majority of important human interactions are lost, which weakens family ties. With the arrival of technology and the technological age, the health of the general populace is declining. The use of technology is widespread, even for the most straightforward tasks. Simple mathematical computations that can be performed manually are one of the responsibilities.</p>
							<p>However, because they do not want to leave their comfort zones, people choose to utilise their technology even when it is not necessary. Kids used to like playing outside activities not too long ago. They would engage in games with other kids in their neighbourhood, which helped them build strength and immunity. The kids were exposed to social life and many obstacles, such resolving disputes, through these interactions.</p>
							<h3><li>Adverse Effects on Children Dependent on Technology</li></h3>
							<p>These children grew up to be better people and were intelligent in life. The current trend is for young children to be exposed to video games on gamepads, joysticks, and the PlayStation instead of group games, which is not the case anymore. As a result of their lack of socialisation, the kids develop low self-esteem and communication issues as they get older.</p>
							<p>Furthermore, because they just think about themselves, they develop selfish traits as children and have terrible behavioural traits. They also find it difficult to create friends. Despite the negative effects of technology today, it is clear from how much it has improved our lives in terms of convenience and usability. The cell phone is one technical device that is useful. The mobile phone is an example of a beneficial technical device. According to estimates, 82 percent of Americans as a whole own cell phones.</p>
							<h3><li>Positive Effects of Technology</li></h3>
							<p>Such ownership suggests that communication and information are accessible and convenient. Notably, the user of the cell phone might obtain a great deal of useful information by simply pushing a single button. For instance, the usage of smartphones allows people to become more fluent in their language and to message more easily, both of which are now crucial components of communication. </p>
							<p>On the other hand, all these advancements in technology suggest that people are losing touch with their culture and sense of reality. Due to the fact that people now use technology for both official and personal purposes, it sometimes appears impossible for individuals to communicate and just exist with all the devices at their disposal. For instance, using computers at work facilitates labour.</p>
							<p>However, if all the information on official documents is lost from these computers, the businesses will be unable to function. Second, individuals would have trouble connecting or staying in touch with one another if the Internet and phones stopped working since they are so accustomed to using them.</p>
						</ol> 
						<h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
						<p>After arriving at work, people go onto their email accounts, respond to their emails, and then log onto social networking sites where they spend the majority of the day. The ideal way for people to stay in touch with their friends and loved ones is through Facebook Messenger. They barely make time to visit them once they are assured that they are fine. In order to fit the social circles, communication between families and friends is actually diluted.</p>
						<p>Children rarely go outside to play at home since they are absorbed in their playstations all the time. The youngsters suffer as a result, performing poorly in school and having weak problem-solving abilities. People rarely use their brains since they mostly rely on technology to perform basic mathematical operations. People are living longer and developing memory issues as a result of utilising technology to its full potential and becoming overly dependent on it.</p>
