                        <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>Engineers are always asked, "why did they let this break?" Or, what is wrong with 'y' for 'x' to happen? It has never been a matter of definite accuracy. It's human nature to try new things; many of which are new ideas that failed. Yes, maybe at the loss of life, but, the saving of many others. And while that may sound like the petty excuse of a child, your children and your children's children will thank you. In the engineering world, many people are focused on the failures of designs and the uselessness of inventions. So today let us analyze a failure to better understand what went wrong. I chose Chernobyl.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">A Look at the Incident of Chernobyl</h2>
                        <p>Chernobyl was a nuclear disaster in 1996 that exploded as a result of untrained personnel and a flawed reactor design. It had a reactor design that became apparently flawed primarily when it was at a low power setting. The real issue was the oddly shaped control rods that were being tried out at the plant. They were put into the reactor, which caused a massive power surge to occur, and pressure tubes to rupture. A reaction to the extremely hot fuel with cold water caused fuel fragmentation and caused a steam explosion. This broke the remaining tubes and created utter mayhem, releasing around 5% of the radioactive material, which was converted into energy in the surrounding areas. </p>
                        <p>At earlier investigations of the site, this issue was blamed on a human error, which would have been a much easier case to deal with rather than to face the real issue of the reactor 4 power surge. This radioactivity in Chernobyl has now given Russian soldiers radioactive sickness from being around it, stirring up the old radiation particles in the atmosphere. This situation was intensified as they were also not wearing protective gear. This was mainly an issue due to them being located in the "Red Forest" a highly radioactive zone at Chernobyl, a zone that many of the ex-workers at Chernobyl said was a suicide mission to be in. This fear from workers, even 30+ years later, goes to show how such a little mistake can cause so much damage. It is said that the place this disaster took place at would be uninhabitable for the next 100 years at the very least. </p>
                        <p>This is a well-known disaster because of the sheer scale of people it has harmed and affected. Unfortunately, this is sometimes the cost of progress and experimentation; however, no disrespect is intended to those who have died there. Their deaths proved a point that many people had been saying for a long time, and finally; they listened to it. You may blame this on the engineers, as many do. However, remember that it also saved it from happening to you in your city or town. Because, as I've said before, this tragedy was just a matter of where and when.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>Humans create new ideas with every generation, just like adaptations. The entire world resets itself anew for a change. We learn from our ancestors and progress, to get us to where we are now. The code of Hammurabi is something many people may wish to enforce in the coming future, considering the growing number of structural issues and failures. The idea of this code is to punish those engineers who do not build "perfect things" or, more clearly, create no progress in their work. By this code, there is no progress from those who wish to make a difference because they will be held by fear that they will be punished for making a faulty invention. For progress to happen, we must allow variables to change instead of restraining them. Instead, others can learn from our mistakes to create a better, stronger future. So remember to not judge others even while it may seem awful at the moment. It is a change that can change society for the better.</p>
