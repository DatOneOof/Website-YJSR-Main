                        <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>Through the years, the definition of short bowel syndrome in the medical literature has varied. Despite that some medical sources seem to reserve the name short bowel syndrome for cases caused by surgical resection of a portion of the small intestine, injury or condition that prevents the proper function of the small intestine even if the length of the bowel is unaffected. Although these congenital cases are often associated with malrotation of the small intestine, the exact cause of congenital short bowel syndrome is unknown.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Signs & Symptoms</h2>
                        <p>The symptoms and severity of short bowel syndrome can vary greatly depending upon the length and function of the remaining or undamaged portion of the small intestine. The small intestine is divided into three main sections: the duodenum, the jejunum and the ileum. In the adult, the normal length of the small intestine is estimated at 600cm and the colon is about 150cm. Individuals who have only 150-200cm of the small intestine and lack a colon may have significant fluid and nutrient losses that often require the use of intravenous fluid and/or nutrients. Although symptoms of short bowel syndrome vary, diarrhea is common. Diarrhea can be severe and can cause dehydration, unintended weight loss, lethargy and eventually malnutrition. Additional symptoms include cramping, fatigue, weakness, bloating and heartburn. Individuals may have pale, greasy stools that contain excess amounts of fat. Short bowel syndrome can lead to poor growth in infants and children due to undernutrition and lack of the proper building blocks for normal growth and development. Additional symptoms associated with it depend upon the failure to absorb sufficient levels of certain vitamins or minerals. For ex-Deficiency of vitamin K can cause prolonged bleeding and a tendency to bruise easily. Affected individuals may develop small red or purple pin prick-sized spots on the skin due to bleeding, discoloration of the skin due to bleeding underneath the surface of the skin and a rash of purple spots on the skin due to internal bleeding.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Causes</h2>
                        <p>It is generally broken down into individuals in whom the disorder is acquired during life and newborns in which the disorder is present at birth. In older children and adults, causes of short bowel syndrome include Crohn's disease; folding of a portion of the intestines into another portion damage to the small intestines because of trauma: damage to the small intestines from lack of blood flow due to a blocked blood vessel, diseases of the blood vessels or overactive blood clotting disorders, damage to the small intestine from cancer or from the treatment of cancer including surgical removal of a cancerous section of the small intestine or radiation enteritis. Radiation enteritis is damage to the lining of the intestine because of radiation therapy and can affect both the small and large intestines.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Diagnosis</h2>
                        <p>A diagnosis of short bowel syndrome is made based upon a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical evaluation and a variety of specialized tests including laboratory tests and X-ray studies. Imaging techniques may be used to assess individuals with it. Such tests include plain abdominal X-rays to detect signs of obstruction or ileus, CT scanning of the abdomen, MRI of the abdomen or an abdominal ultrasound. During CT scanning, a computer and X-rays are used to create a film showing cross-sectional images of certain tissue structures. An abdominal CAT scan enables physicians to identify problems such as bowel obstruction and assess the health of the liver. An abdominal ultrasound may be used to detect biliary sludge or gallstones, which are often associated with short bowel syndrome. An upper gastrointestinal series with a small bowel follow-through and abdominal MRI, allows physicians to detect areas of stricture or abnormal connections within the small bowels and assess the health of the lining of the small bowel.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Treatment</h2>
                        <p>
                            It has two goals: to ease symptoms and give you enough vitamins and minerals. The kind of treatment you get depends on how severe your condition is;
                            <ul>
                                <li>For mild cases, you may need to have several small meals a day, along with extra fluids, vitamins, and minerals. Your doctor will probably also give you medicine for diarrhea.</li>
                                <li>Treatment is the same for moderate cases, but from time to time, you may need extra fluids and minerals through an IV.</li>
                                <li>For more serious cases, you may get an IV feeding tube instead of eating meals or you may have a tube placed directly into your small intestine. If your condition improves enough, you can stop the tube feedings.</li>
                                <li>In the most severe cases, people need IV feeding tubes all the time.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>Over the last years, the management of affected patients has remarkably improved with the increase in patients' quality of life and survival, mainly thanks to advances in home-based parenteral nutrition (PN). In the last ten years new treatment strategies have become available together with increasing experience and the encouraging results with new drugs, such as teduglutide, have added a new dimension to the management of Short bowel syndrome.</p>
