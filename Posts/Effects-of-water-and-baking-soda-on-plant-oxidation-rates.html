                        <h2 class="section-heading">Summary</h2>
                        <p>Droughts, wildfires, invasive pest outbreaks, etc. are affected by temperature. These added stresses can limit plant productivity (nps). Namely, photosynthesis, transpiration, germination, respiration, and flowering are all affected (Extension Web). Moreover, studies have shown how a plant’s rate of reproductive development can increase with increasing temperatures (Proctor). This lab intends to prove that warmer temperatures of about 40 degrees Celsius allow for an increase of oxidation, thus promoting photosynthesis efficiency. On the other hand, this lab will demonstrate how lower temperatures, tested around 7 degrees Celsius, will hinder a plants ability to oxidize and thus reduce the rate of photosynthesis. Nevertheless, temperatures highly above and below a range near 40 degrees Celsius will decrease photosynthetic rate. Photosynthetic ability will be measured by how many chads rise within a 20-minute period. Every two minutes, the number of chads that reach the surface of the beaker is measured not only compare end results, but rates along the way.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>While temperature was compared for chads integrated in water, chads were also placed in a baking soda solution to measure whether this would also increase the ability for chads to rise. This lab also aims to prove that baking soda solutions will allow plants to oxidize faster, and the chads rose faster consistently amongst the baking soda solutions.</p>
                        <p>The null hypothesis states that there will be no significant variation in oxidation, or the number of chads rising, that cannot be attributed to random chance or sampling error, due to temperature variations, meaning that the variable at hand will have no effect on a plant’s photosynthetic rate. To add, the presence of baking soda will neither hinder nor increase a plant’s ability to oxidize, a measure of photosynthetic rate.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, the alternative hypothesis aims to show that temperatures around 40 degrees Celsius will cause more chads to rise faster, promoting oxidation and as a product of photosynthesis, it will indicate successful completion. To add, chads rise faster in solutions containing baking soda as opposed to the plain water beaker.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Results</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>1 chad rose in the water beaker and 4 in the baking soda beaker after a 20-minute period <i>(Figure 1)</i>.</li>
                            <li>8 chads rose by the end of the water beaker’s 20-minute period while 10 rose in the baking soda solution within 10 minutes <i>(Figure 2)</i>.</li>
                            <li>All ten chads rose in both beakers within ten minutes <i>(Figure 3)</i>.</li>
                            <li>The 2SEM data bars between minutes 10-14 do not overlap <i>(Figure 2)</i>.</li>
                            <li>Data bars do not overlap between minutes 14-20 and the baking soda solution has 2-4 more chads that rose throughout <i>(Figure 1)</i>.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Discussion</h2>
                        <p>The evidence illustrates that temperatures close to 40 degrees Celsius will allow more chads to rise. First, only 1 chad rose in the water beaker and 4 in the baking soda beaker after a 20-minute period (Figure 1). This suggests that cold temperatures are not optimal for oxidation rate, measured by the number of chads that rose. Second, 8 chads rose by the end of the water beaker’s 20-minute period while 10 rose in the baking soda solution within 10 minutes (Figure 2). This emphasizes a significant productivity increase as temperature increased. Finally, all ten chads rose in both beakers within ten minutes (Figure 3). This also displays an increase in oxidation between the two graphs. This is because the higher the kinetic energy, measured by temperatures, will allow for collisions between substrates and enzymes to increase, which means there is more binding at the active site and more reactions are catalyzed. In these chemical reactions, the molecule loses one or more electrons- resulting in oxidation as water loses its (2) electrons. This oxygen is a product of photosynthesis- and thus the production of oxygen demonstrates completion of the process. However, at temperature extremes, the enzymes will denature and cannot catalyze the chemical reaction, preventing oxidation and the number of chads that can rise. The chi square table further contradicts the null that temperature does not have a significant effect on oxidation rate. With 95% confidence at 5 degrees of freedom and a critical value of 11.1, the chi square value of 15.29 is greater, so the null is rejected. As explained above by the graphs, the alternate hypothesis, temperatures close to 40 degrees Celsius promote oxidation efficiency, is accepted as there is a significant difference in the number of chads that rose between graphs. The next section of the data proves that baking soda is necessary for photosynthesis to occur. It serves as a limiting reactant; the amount of product is directly tied to its abundance. There is a limited amount of carbon dioxide in water, but the baking soda solution has a significantly larger amount of carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide as a gas enters the leaf through the stomata and diffuses into mesophyll cells. It is fixed into organic molecules such as glucose in photosynthesis. Carbon dioxide combines with water to create carbohydrates, energy-storing substances. In the Calvin cycle, also known as the dark reaction or light-independent process of photosynthesis, carbon fixation occurs, and carbon dioxide is catalyzed by an enzyme known as Rubisco. The product splits into 3 phosphoglycerates, a phosphate group is added to each by a kinase enzyme. The result, diphosphoglycerate, is converted into glyceraldehyde (G3P) and results in the formation of glucose. Therefore, carbon dioxide is a substrate that is catalyzed by fitting into the specific “lock and key” fit active site of an enzyme. The more substrates present in a reaction, the more active sites can be filled and the more catalyzation that can occur. Ultimately, this will reach a limit when all active sites are filled, and the rate will neither increase nor decrease. While this is a light-independent reaction and carbon dioxides has a comparable effect on the light-dependent process studied, light was present throughout the experiment to guarantee the reaction described below took place. As it directly applies to this light-dependent photosynthesis experiment, carbon dioxide (the result of baking soda and water) serves as a reactant that is reduced, or gains electrons from oxidized water (in the presence of light). Consequently, water transforms into oxygen and carbon dioxide’s transformation allows energy to be stored within the glucose molecules. This can be measured by oxidation as the amount of oxygen depends on the presence of carbon dioxide (amongst other factors). Namely, the 2SEM data bars between minutes 10-14 do not overlap (although, the rest is elaborated in sources of error), indicating a significant difference between oxidation, a direct result of carbon dioxide abundance (Figure 2). The baking soda solution had 6 more chads that rose, meaning that it was more efficient in the solution with dissolved carbon dioxide. This is also shown in another graph, where data bars do not overlap between minutes 14-20 and the baking soda solution has 2-4 more chads that rose throughout, indicating a more effective photosynthetic rate that directly corresponds with the amount of reactant carbon dioxide (Figure 1). This data rejects the null that carbon dioxide has no significant effect on photosynthesis while confirming the alternate hypothesis that the carbon dioxide-diffused baking soda solution enhanced oxidative rates.</p>
