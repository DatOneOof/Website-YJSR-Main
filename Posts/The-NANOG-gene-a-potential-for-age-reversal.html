                        <p>Scientists around the globe are embracing the possibility of the reversal of the aging process and are gradually advancing in ways to hamper the progression of cellular and muscular decline while sustaining its regenerative properties. Particularly, Stelios Andreadis and his team of chemical engineers from the University of Buffalo have proposed that the NANOG embryonic gene can be utilized to alter developed adult stem cells and skeletal muscle cells.</p>
                        <p>In a study published in Cell Reports, it is suggested that the NANOG gene is associated with the functionality of mitochondria, an organelle that conducts biochemical processes such as cellular respiration creating energy for the cell. It has been further scrutinized to determine its potential role in combating cellular aging. The name NANOG is derived from Irish mythology revolving around the Land of Eternal Youth. The gene proposes the ability to reverse cellular senescence, which refers to a process entailing the gradual deterioration of the functionality of a living organism. It accomplishes this by rehabilitating metabolic pathways within the body to uphold healthy and sustained bodily functionality.</p>
                        <p>The research conducted proposes hope for various genetic disorders that result in age-related complications. The research team studied mature mesenchymal stem cells, which are cells characterized by their lack of differentiation — the maturation process of an unspecialized cell. Furthermore, these specific cells have a hampered ability to engage in cellular division. After investigation, the scientists discovered that glycolysis and cellular respiration were both delayed biological processes involved in the production of adenosine triphosphate, or ATP. This causes the cells to break down glutamine, an amino acid, to have an additional source of energy. Although, this furtherly increases the rate of aging due to the accumulation of urea and its consequent obstruction of mitochondrial respiration.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, to counter this process, the team utilized Glutaminase 1, which is an enzyme that prevents the decomposition of glutamine. By doing this, the team was able to slow down cellular senescence by revamping cellular respiration. These results were corroborated by a similar study conducted on patients with the Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome, which is a disease that speeds up the aging process in children.</p>
                        <p>Similar to stem cells, skeletal muscle cells also feature hampered glycolysis and insulin resistance. These particular cells are called myoblasts, the cells that make up muscle tissue. To create energy in the form of ATP, these cells break down an amino acid called methionine, which is commonly found in meat and dairy products. This process exacerbates cellular senescence as it produces a large quantity of ammonium. By utilizing the NANOG gene, the production of methionine adenosyltransferase 2A, an enzyme that aids in dissolving methionine, was hampered. The sequential result was improved insulin sensitivity, increased glucose utilization, decreased ammonium, and better muscle regeneration.</p>
                        <p>The positive results of the studies conducted indicate the potentiality of new medicines that target cellular senescence and the age reversal of cells. It provides newfound hope for genetic disorders that are associated with the rapid aging of cells. The results demonstrate that improving metabolism through the NANOG gene may alleviate key indicators of aging.</p>
