                        <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>Medicine is constantly developing and transforming with new discoveries that enable doctors to cure diseases through various techniques. An example of such a discovery is CRISPR gene editing. However there are many ethical and safety concerns surrounding this new treatment. According to the National Human Genome Research Institute, 40 countries have discouraged or banned research on germline editing.</p>
                        <p>He Jiankui, a Chinese biophysics researcher, edited genes involved with HIV infection of two human embryos back in 2015, and consequently faced three year imprisonment for ‘illegal medical practice’. Gene editing is not a typical discovery: it comes with great developments yet many ethical and safety concerns, very similar to discoveries such as robotics in surgery, and artificial intelligence.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">About CRISPR Gene Editing</h2>
                        <p>The CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) system is composed of repeating sequences that are naturally found in prokaryotic organisms such as bacteria and archaea. One defence mechanism, to protect prokaryotes against bacterial viruses is using CRISPR. When a virus inserts itself into a bacterial cell, a segment of DNA is inserted into the bacterial genome, known as the CRISPR locus. CRISPRs consist of repeating sequences of genetic code with spacer sequences in between. This creates something similar to a record of past infections, like the function of memory cells in the immune system of a human. These sequences are copied into RNA strands(guide RNA), and RNA is spliced into functional units by tracrRNA: each unit consists of a viral sequence and a repeat. This unit as well as the tracrRNA binds to a CAS9 protein. CAS9 proteins are nucleases, a type of enzyme that can cut DNA. When the guide RNA finds its molecular target in the viral genome, the CAS9 cuts the target DNA. Hence this disables the virus. Repair after the DNA cut occurs via two different methods: non-homologous end joining , which leads to a random insertion or deletion of DNA or homology-directed repair-this is where a homologous piece of DNA is utilised as a template. After witnessing this phenomenon of a defence mechanism in prokaryotic organisms, researchers realised that a similar method can be used to cut any DNA sequence at a specific location. This can be done by altering the guide DNA to match its target.</p>
                        <p>A promising application of CRISPR technology is treating genetic disorders caused by mutations of a single gene. Although the approach has so far only been tested out in a preclinical setting, scientists hope that they can translate this into the clinical setting in the later future. <br>A study by Schwank and other scientists investigated the effect of CRISPR technology on Cystic Fibrosis. Adult stem cells from the intestine of two patients with cystic fibrosis were obtained. Through this process, they successfully corrected the most common mutation causing cystic fibrosis in intestinal organoids.</p>
                        <p>CRISPR also has the potential to cure HIV. Despite significant efforts taken to cure HIV, AIDs still remains a threat to human health. About 36.9 million people worldwide were living with HIV by the end of 2017. Although HAART drugs can suppress the replication of the virus, it cannot eradicate the virus completely from the individual’s body. In a recent study, scientists used a CRISPR gene editing approach to locate human genes that were important in HIV infection in the blood, where 40 were genes that had never been considered before as being important in HIV infection. This is a large step forward as it reveals more about how the virus replicates, and therefore leads scientists closer to a potential cure. Ebina et al. suppressed HIV gene-1 expression in Jurkat cells by targeting HIV-1 with CRISPR technology. Another study carried out by Deng.et al established a CRISPR system in hematopoietic cells and showed that this system displayed resistance in vivo.</p>
                        <p>This technology brings hope that mutations can be edited out of the gene pool. Thousands of families have watched their children suffer due to genetic effects. What will this discovery mean for them? Not only this, it increases the divide between the wealthy and the poor. There is no doubt that CRISPR will be an expensive piece of technology, which means that only the rich will be able to afford it. Furthermore, many medical researchers agree that CRISPR gene editing should be utilised in curing genetic diseases, and not genetic enhancement. George.Q. Daley, a dean of Harvard Medical School commented, ‘There are stark differences between editing genes in an embryo to prevent a baby being born with sickle cell anaemia and editing genes to alter the appearance and intelligence of future generations.’However where does one draw the line in the spectrum of genetic diseases and genetic enhancement? In some cases those with edited genes could have been fine without edited genes. Another concern stemmed from the act which He Jiankui, an aforementioned researcher of biophysics and a non-medical professional perpetrated. CRISPR is a relatively easy technology to use, which led He to be able to use it. Although most practitioners will self-regulate themselves with this technology, many medical professionals agree that an international set of regulations should be in place to prevent future incidents of misuse.</p>
                        <p>There are several safety concerns regarding the use of CRISPR as well. In order to safely deliver Cas9 nuclease encoding genes and guide RNAs without risk of toxicity in vivo(to the embryo), a vector is required. Despite being presented with many options of vectors such as ADV vectors, lentivirus vectors and adeno-associated viral vectors, they all have their limitations such as an increased risk of off-target effects and small packaging sizes which then leads to a reduced efficacy of delivery. A suitable vector must be found, in order for CRISPR to be delivered safely and efficiently.  Another significant concern is the possibility of another part of the genome being targeted rather than the intended part as this will cause long-term complications for the patient. It has been discovered that the concentration of Cas9 nuclease enzyme and the length of time Cas9 is expressed affects off-target activity. However, further work must be done to minimise off-target effects.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>CRISPR technology has the potential to revolutionise medicine  in the treatment of many genetic conditions such as cystic fibrosis and even HIV. However, there are a number of ethical challenges that must be addressed before this can be employed in the clinical setting.</p>
